*    Patients treated with TALVEY® 0.4 mg/kg weekly dosing schedule (N=143) achieved significantly longer mPFS, mTTNT and mOS compared to real world SoC (p<0.0001; N=177)*.
     *    *An external control arm for MonumenTAL-1 (indirect comparison) was created using individual patient level data from patients in LocoMMotion with an mFU period of 26.4 months (data cut-off: October 2022) and 9.3 months in MoMMent (data cut-off: March 2023) who met MonumenTAL-1 (data cut-off: January 2023) eligibility criteria
