- Original Title: Host Immune Response to Influenza A Virus Infection
- Original Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are contagious pathogens responsible for severe respiratory infection in humans and animals worldwide. Upon detection of IAV infection, host immune system aims to defend against and clear the viral infection. Innate immune system is comprised of physical barriers (mucus and collectins), various phagocytic cells, group of cytokines, interferons (IFNs), and IFN-stimulated genes, which provide first line of defense against IAV infection. The adaptive immunity is mediated by B cells and T cells, characterized with antigen-specific memory cells, capturing and neutralizing the pathogen. The humoral immune response functions through hemagglutinin-specific circulating antibodies to neutralize IAV. In addition, antibodies can bind to the surface of infected cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement activation. Although there are neutralizing antibodies against the virus, cellular immunity also plays a crucial role in the fight against IAVs. On the other hand, IAVs have developed multiple strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we discuss how immune system, especially innate immune system and critical molecules are involved in the antiviral defense against IAVs. In addition, we high- light how IAVs antagonize different immune responses to achieve a successful infection.

1. OVERVIEW

- Main research objective: To review the host immune response to Influenza A virus (IAV) infection, focusing on both innate and adaptive immunity, and to describe the mechanisms by which IAV evades the immune system.
- Central question/problem: How does the host immune system respond to IAV infection, and how does IAV counteract these responses?
- Context and relevance: IAV is a significant human and animal pathogen causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Understanding the host-virus interaction is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.

2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

- General approach: This is a review article, synthesizing information from previously published research. It does not present new experimental data.
- Specific tools and methods: The review draws upon a variety of methods used in the cited studies, including *in vitro* cell culture experiments, *in vivo* animal models (particularly mice), and clinical studies in humans. Techniques mentioned include flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, gene knockout studies, and biochemical assays.
- Analyzed data/samples: The review discusses data derived from studies using human and animal cells (especially airway epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells), as well as data from animal models and human infections.
- Relevant methodological innovations: Not a primary focus of the review, but the cited studies use a range of techniques, including genetic manipulation of viruses and host cells, advanced microscopy, and molecular biology techniques.

3. KEY FINDINGS

- Primary discoveries:
  *  Main findings addressing the central question: The host immune response to IAV involves both innate (immediate, non-specific) and adaptive (slower, specific) components.  The innate response includes physical barriers, cytokines (especially type I and III interferons), and cells like macrophages and NK cells.  The adaptive response involves T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and B cells (producing antibodies). IAV has developed multiple mechanisms to evade these responses, primarily by interfering with interferon signaling and antigen presentation.
  *  Key results from the study:
     - IAV primarily infects airway and alveolar epithelial cells, using hemagglutinin (HA) to bind to sialic acid receptors.
     - Innate immune sensing of IAV occurs via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like RIG-I and TLRs, leading to interferon production.
     - Interferons induce the expression of antiviral proteins (ISGs) like MxA, IFITMs, CH25H, and TRIM proteins, which inhibit various stages of the viral life cycle.
     - NK cells kill infected cells, and macrophages phagocytose infected cells and debris.
     - Dendritic cells (DCs) activate T cells, leading to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and CD4+ helper T cell responses.
     - B cells produce neutralizing antibodies, primarily targeting HA.
     - IAV proteins, especially NS1, but also PB1-F2, PB2, and NA, antagonize the host immune response through various mechanisms.
  * Secondary relevant findings:  Mucosal immunity, particularly secretory IgA (s-IgA), plays a role in protection at the respiratory tract surface.  Autophagy is involved in both immune responses and viral evasion.
  * Unexpected results (if any): Not explicitly stated, but the review highlights the complexity and ongoing discoveries in the field, implying that some findings are relatively new.

- Practical implications of findings: Understanding the host-virus interaction informs the development of antiviral drugs (targeting viral evasion mechanisms) and improved vaccines (aiming for robust and long-lasting immunity).

4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

- General conclusions: The host immune response to IAV is multifaceted, involving both innate and adaptive immunity. IAV has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade these responses, leading to a complex interplay between virus and host.
- Practical applications: The review highlights the need for continued research to develop effective antiviral strategies, including better vaccines and drugs that target viral evasion mechanisms.
- Study limitations: As a review, it is limited by the scope and quality of the studies it summarizes.  The field is constantly evolving, so some information may become outdated.
