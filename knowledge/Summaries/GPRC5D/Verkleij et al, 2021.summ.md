# Preclinical activity and determinants of response of the GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody talquetamab in multiple myeloma

**Abstract:** (Provided Verbatim)

Cell surface expression levels of GPRC5D, an orphan G protein–coupled receptor, are
significantly higher on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, compared with normal plasma cells or
other immune cells, which renders it a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies.
The novel GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody, talquetamab, effectively
kills GPRC5D1 MM cell lines in the presence of T cells from both healthy donors or heavily
pretreated MM patients. In addition, talquetamab has potent anti-MM activity in bone
marrow (BM) samples from 45 patients, including those with high-risk cytogenetic
aberrations. There was no difference in talquetamab-mediated killing of MM cells from
newly diagnosed, daratumumab-na¨ıve relapsed/refractory (median of 3 prior therapies),
and daratumumab-refractory (median of 6 prior therapies) MM patients. Tumor cell
lysis was accompanied by T-cell activation and degranulation, as well as production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. High levels of GPRC5D and high effector:target ratio were
associated with improved talquetamab-mediated lysis of MM cells, whereas an increased
proportion of T cells expressing PD-1 or HLA-DR, and elevated regulatory T-cell (Treg) counts
were associated with suboptimal killing. In cell line experiments, addition of Tregs to
effector cells decreased MM cell lysis. Direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells also
impaired the efficacy of talquetamab. Combination therapy with daratumumab or
pomalidomide enhanced talquetamab-mediated lysis of primary MM cells in an additive
fashion. In conclusion, we show that the GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific
antibody talquetamab is a promising novel antimyeloma agent. These results provide the
preclinical rationale for ongoing studies with talquetamab in relapsed/refractory MM.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This research article describes the preclinical evaluation of talquetamab, a novel bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D and CD3, for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).  The study investigates talquetamab's *in vitro* activity against MM cell lines and primary MM cells from patient bone marrow samples, and explores factors that influence its efficacy.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

*   **Cell Lines and Primary Samples:**
    *   MM cell lines (U266, RPMI-8226, MM.1S, UM9) with varying GPRC5D expression levels.
    *   Primary MM cells from bone marrow aspirates of:
        *   Newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients.
        *   Daratumumab-naïve relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) patients.
        *   Daratumumab-refractory (DARA-R) MM patients.
    *   Normal bone marrow samples from age-matched patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery.
    *   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified T cells from healthy donors.
*   **Flow Cytometry:** Used to assess GPRC5D and BCMA protein expression on MM cells and other cell populations.
*   **Cytotoxicity Assays:**
    *   Bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-based cytotoxicity assays with luciferase-transduced MM cell lines.
    *   Flow cytometry-based assays to measure MM cell killing in patient bone marrow samples.
* **Treg Isolation:**
    *  Immune-magnetic cell isolation kit.
*   **T-Cell Activation and Degranulation Assays:**  Flow cytometry to measure CD25 (activation marker) and CD107a (degranulation marker) expression on T cells.
*   **Cytokine Measurement:**  Multiplex assays to quantify cytokine production in cell culture supernatants.
*   **Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) Coculture:** MM cells were cocultured with BMSCs, either in direct contact or separated by transwell inserts, to assess the impact of the BM microenvironment on talquetamab efficacy.
*   **Combination Studies:** Talquetamab was combined with daratumumab or pomalidomide to evaluate potential synergistic or additive effects.
*   **Gene Expression Profiling:** Used to evaluate GPRC5D mRNA expression in a larger cohort of MM patients.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **Talquetamab Effectively Kills MM Cell Lines:** Talquetamab induced potent, dose-dependent killing of GPRC5D-positive MM cell lines *in vitro* in the presence of T cells.
*   **Talquetamab Kills Primary MM Cells:** Talquetamab effectively eliminated primary MM cells from patient bone marrow samples, regardless of prior treatment status (NDMM, RRMM, DARA-R).
*   **T-Cell Activation and Degranulation:** Talquetamab treatment led to T-cell activation (increased CD25 expression) and degranulation (increased CD107a expression).
*   **Cytokine Production:** Talquetamab induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) in cocultures.
*   **Factors Influencing Efficacy:**
    *   **GPRC5D Expression:** Higher GPRC5D expression on MM cells correlated with greater talquetamab-mediated lysis.
    *   **Effector:Target (E:T) Ratio:** Higher E:T ratios were associated with improved MM cell killing.
    *   **T Cell Exhaustion Markers:** Increased expression of PD-1 and HLA-DR on T cells was associated with reduced talquetamab efficacy.
    *   **Tregs:**  Presence of Tregs impaired talquetamab-mediated MM cell lysis and T-cell activation.
    *   **BMSCs:** Direct contact with BMSCs reduced talquetamab efficacy, partially through downregulation of GPRC5D on MM cells.
*   **Combination Therapies:**
    *   **Daratumumab:**  Combination with daratumumab showed additive anti-MM activity, but daratumumab also reduced T-cell activation and degranulation.
    *   **Pomalidomide:** Combination with pomalidomide showed additive anti-MM activity and enhanced T-cell activation.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

Talquetamab is a promising novel agent for the treatment of MM, demonstrating potent *in vitro* activity against both MM cell lines and primary patient cells.  Its efficacy is influenced by tumor cell characteristics (GPRC5D expression) and immune cell characteristics (E:T ratio, T cell activation/exhaustion markers, Treg frequency).  Combination strategies with daratumumab or pomalidomide may further enhance talquetamab's anti-MM activity.
