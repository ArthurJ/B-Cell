# Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 Bispecific T-Cell–Redirecting Antibody for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma

**Abstract:**
Although treatment advances over recent decades have significantly improved survival of patients with multiple myeloma, there is still an unmet medical need for more effective treatments. In this study, we identified G-protein–coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) expression on the surface of malignant cells involved in multiple myeloma, but except for plasma cells and B cells, not at appreciable levels on normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, we constructed IgG-based anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific T-cell–redirecting antibodies (GPRC5D TRAB), which suppressed the tumor growth of GPRC5D-positive myeloma cells through the activation of T cells in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. Collectively, these findings suggest that GPRC5D is an antigen specific to multiple myeloma and a potential target of TRAB therapy.

**1. OVERVIEW**
This research article describes the identification of GPRC5D as a potential therapeutic target in multiple myeloma (MM) and the development and preclinical evaluation of anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific T-cell–redirecting antibodies (TRABs) for the treatment of MM.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

*   **Target Identification:**
    *   Microarray analysis of gene expression in malignant plasma cells from MM patients (n=8) versus normal B cells from healthy donors (n=7).
    *   Analysis of GPRC5D mRNA expression in a panel of normal human tissues (GTEx database).
*   **Antibody Generation:**
    *   Immunization of rabbits with a plasmid DNA encoding human GPRC5D.
    *   Identification of B cells producing anti-GPRC5D antibodies.
    *   Sequencing of antibody variable regions.
    *   Construction of recombinant IgG-based bispecific antibodies (GPRC5D TRABs) targeting both GPRC5D and CD3ε, with modifications to the Fc region (L235R/S239K/N297A) to abolish binding to Fcγ receptors.
*   **In Vitro Characterization of TRABs:**
    *   Flow cytometry to assess binding affinity to GPRC5D-expressing cells (CHO cells and myeloma cell lines) and to CD3ε.
    *   Biacore analysis for kinetic assessment
    *   Luciferase reporter assays (GloResponse NFAT-luc2 Jurkat cells) to measure T-cell activation.
    *   LDH cytotoxicity assays to evaluate T-cell–dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) against myeloma cell lines.
    *   Cytokine release assays (CBA) to measure cytokine production by activated T cells.
*   **In Vivo Efficacy Studies:**
    *   NOD-SCID mouse xenograft models:  Mice were inoculated with human T cells and GPRC5D-expressing myeloma cell lines (NCI-H929 or KMS-26).  TRABs were administered intravenously.
    *   Humanized NOG mouse model: NOG mice were engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and then inoculated with NCI-H929 cells. TRABs were administered intravenously.
*   **Gene expression analysis:**
    *   RNA was collected from tumor samples and analyzed via the nCounter.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **GPRC5D is Highly Expressed in MM Cells:** GPRC5D mRNA was highly expressed in malignant plasma cells from MM patients, but showed very limited expression in normal B cells and other normal tissues (except for some expression in the lung and skin).  This was validated at the protein level by flow cytometry.
*   **GPRC5D Expression is Restricted on Normal Hematopoietic Cells:** Flow cytometry confirmed that GPRC5D protein was not detectable on normal T cells, NK cells, monocytes, granulocytes, or bone marrow progenitors (including HSCs).
*   **Generation of Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 TRABs:**  The researchers generated four rabbit-derived anti-GPRC5D mAbs and engineered them into IgG-based bispecific TRABs (GPA0018, GPA0021, GPA0032, GPA0039) that bind to both GPRC5D and CD3ε.
*   **TRABs Bind to GPRC5D and CD3:** Flow cytometry confirmed that the TRABs bound to GPRC5D-expressing cells.  GPA0018 and GPA0039 showed stronger binding affinity than GPA0021 and GPA0032.
*   **TRABs Induce T-Cell Activation:** Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the GPRC5D TRABs induced T-cell activation in the presence of GPRC5D-expressing target cells.  GPA0018 and GPA0039 showed stronger activation.
*   **TRABs Mediate Potent Cytotoxicity:**  *In vitro* LDH assays showed that GPA0018 and GPA0039 TRABs induced potent T-cell–dependent cytotoxicity against GPRC5D-expressing myeloma cell lines, but not against a GPRC5D-negative cell line. Cytotoxicity was dependent on effector cells.
*   **TRABs Induce Cytokine Release:**  Coculture of T cells and myeloma cells with GPA0018 or GPA0039 TRABs led to the release of various cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4, IL-2).
*   **TRABs Show Antitumor Activity In Vivo:**
    *   In NOD-SCID mouse xenograft models, both GPA0018 and GPA0039 TRABs significantly reduced tumor growth, with some mice becoming tumor-free.
    *   In a humanized NOG mouse model (engrafted with human HSCs), GPA0039 TRAB also showed significant antitumor activity.
* **Gene Expression Profiling**
    *   Upregulated genes were involved in immune activation, T-cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

GPRC5D is a promising therapeutic target for multiple myeloma due to its restricted expression pattern and cell surface localization.  The anti-GPRC5D/CD3 TRABs developed in this study demonstrate potent *in vitro* and *in vivo* antitumor activity against GPRC5D-expressing myeloma cells, mediated by T-cell activation and cytotoxicity. These findings support the further development of GPRC5D-targeted therapies for MM.
