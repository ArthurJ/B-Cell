# Cytokine production by human B cells: role in health and autoimmune disease

**Abstract:** (Provided verbatim)
B cells are classically considered solely as antibody-producing cells driving humoral immune responses to foreign antigens in infections and vaccinations as well as self-antigens in pathological settings such as autoimmunity. However, it has now become clear that B cells can also secrete a vast array of cytokines, which influence both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Indeed, similarly to T cells, there is significant heterogeneity in cytokine-driven responses by B cells, ranging from the production of pro-inflammatory effector cytokines such as IL-6, through to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. In this review, focusing on human B cells, we summarize the key findings that have revealed that cytokine-producing B cell subsets have critical functions in healthy immune responses and contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article focuses on the *non-antibody* functions of B cells, specifically their ability to produce cytokines. It challenges the traditional view of B cells as solely antibody factories and explores their roles as immunomodulatory cells.  The central theme is that B cells, like T cells, exhibit significant heterogeneity in cytokine production and can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, depending on context and stimuli.  The review primarily focuses on human B cells.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

As a review, this paper presents no original experimental data.  It synthesizes information from previously published studies, implying the use of methodologies including:

*   **In vitro studies:**  Experiments with human B cell lines and primary B cells, stimulating them with various agents (e.g., BCR cross-linking, CD40L, TLR ligands) and measuring cytokine production.
*   **In vivo studies:** (Mentioned, but less focus than human studies): Mouse models of autoimmunity and infection.
*   **Human studies:**  Analysis of B cells from healthy individuals and patients with autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE, RA, MS) or other conditions.  Analysis of clinical trial data (e.g., B cell depletion therapy).
*   **Molecular biology and immunology techniques:** Flow cytometry, ELISA, gene expression analysis, etc.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **Early Studies:**  Early research (1980s and 1990s) demonstrated that human B cells, particularly after activation, could produce a variety of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, LT, and IFN-α.
*   **Context-Dependent Cytokine Production:**  The specific cytokines produced by B cells depend heavily on the stimuli they receive.  For example, BCR cross-linking + CD40 stimulation leads to different cytokine profiles than CD40 stimulation alone.
*   **Pro-inflammatory B Cells (Be1, Be2):**  B cells can differentiate into effector subsets (analogous to Th1 and Th2 cells) that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and LT.  These cells can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage.
*   **Regulatory B Cells (Bregs):**  B cells can also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-10, but also TGF-β and IL-35.  These "Bregs" suppress immune responses and maintain tolerance.  Multiple Breg subsets have been described, with varying phenotypes.
*  **Metabolic Regulation:**  Metabolic pathways and metabolites (e.g., glycolysis, succinate, butyrate, lactate) can influence IL-10 production in B cells.
*   **B Cells in Autoimmune Diseases:**  Dysregulation of cytokine production by B cells is implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including SLE, RA, and MS.  Studies have shown:
    *   Altered balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory B cell subsets.
    *   Defective IL-10 production or impaired responsiveness to IL-10 in some patients.
    *   Increased IL-6 production.
*   **B Cell Depletion Therapy (BCDT):**  The use of anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g., rituximab) to deplete B cells has shown clinical efficacy in some autoimmune diseases.  However, the mechanisms are complex and may involve not only the removal of autoantibody-producing cells but also the modulation of cytokine-producing B cell subsets.
* **B-1 Cells**:
    *  B-1 cells are involved in the innate immune response.
    *  B-1a and B-1b cells are described.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

Human B cells are not just antibody factories; they are versatile immunomodulatory cells capable of producing a wide range of cytokines.  Their cytokine production is context-dependent and plays critical roles in both promoting and suppressing immune responses. Dysregulation of B cell cytokine production contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing effective therapies.
