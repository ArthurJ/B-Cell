# A T-cell–redirecting bispecific G-protein–coupled receptor class 5 member D x CD3 antibody to treat multiple myeloma

**Abstract:** (Provided Verbatim)
T-cell–mediated approaches have shown promise in myeloma treatment. However, there are currently a limited number of specific myeloma antigens that can be targeted, and multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. G-protein–coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D) is expressed in MM and smoldering MM patient plasma cells. Here, we demonstrate that GPRC5D protein is present on the surface of MM cells and describe JNJ-64407564, a GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody that recruits CD31 T cells to GPRC5D1 MM cells and induces killing of GPRC5D1 cells. In vitro, JNJ-64407564 induced specific cytotoxicity of GPRC5D1 cells with concomitant T-cell activation and also killed plasma cells in MM patient samples ex vivo. JNJ-64407564 can recruit T cells and induce tumor regression in GPRC5D1 MM murine models, which coincide with T-cell infiltration at the tumor site. This antibody is also able to induce cytotoxicity of patient primary MM cells from bone marrow, which is the natural site of this disease. GPRC5D is a promising surface antigen for MM immunotherapy, and JNJ-64407564 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory MM (NCT03399799).

**1. OVERVIEW**
This research article describes the development and preclinical evaluation of JNJ-64407564, a bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D and CD3, for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The study investigates GPRC5D expression in MM and normal tissues, and evaluates the *in vitro* and *in vivo* activity of JNJ-64407564.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**
* **Target Validation:**
    * Microarray gene expression analysis of MM cells vs. normal B cells.
     *  qPCR analysis of GPRC5D mRNA expression in a panel of normal human tissues.
    * Flow cytometry analysis of GPRC5D protein expression on MM cell lines, primary MM cells, normal B cells, and other normal hematopoietic cells.
    *  Amnis imaging flow cytometry for surface localization.
    * Generation of GPRC5D and BCMA knockout (KO) cell lines using CRISPR.

* **Antibody Development:**
    * Generation of rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against GPRC5D.
    * Engineering of a humanized IgG4 bispecific antibody (JNJ-64407564) targeting GPRC5D and CD3ε, using a DuoBody platform (controlled Fab-arm exchange).
    * Generation of control antibodies: GPRC5DxNull and NullxCD3.

* **In Vitro Assays:**
    *  Binding affinity assessment using flow cytometry and Biacore (surface plasmon resonance).
    *  Luciferase reporter assays (NFAT-luc2 Jurkat cells) to measure T-cell activation.
    *  LDH cytotoxicity assays to assess T-cell–dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC).
    *  Cytokine release assays (CBA) to measure cytokine production.
    *  Whole blood assays to assess activity in a more physiological environment.

* **In Vivo Studies:**
    *  NOD-SCID mouse xenograft models (NCI-H929 and KMS-26 cell lines) with adoptive transfer of human T cells.
    *  Humanized NOG mouse model (engrafted with human CD34+ HSCs) with NCI-H929 xenografts.
    * Assessment of tumor growth, survival, and T-cell infiltration (immunohistochemistry).
* **Gene expression analysis**
    *  nCounter Human Immunology v2 Expression panel

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **GPRC5D Expression:** GPRC5D is highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in MM cells, with limited expression in normal tissues (primarily plasma cells and some expression in lung, skin, and testis).  Expression is heterogeneous within MM patient samples.
*   **Antibody Generation:**  JNJ-64407564, a humanized IgG4 bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D and CD3ε, was successfully generated.
*   **In Vitro Activity:**
    *   JNJ-64407564 binds to both GPRC5D and CD3ε.
    *   JNJ-64407564 induces potent T-cell activation and TDCC against GPRC5D-expressing MM cell lines.
    *   JNJ-64407564 induces cytokine release (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4, IL-2).
    * JNJ-64407564 depletes primary MM cells from patient bone marrow samples.
    *  JNJ-64407564 shows activity in human whole blood, although at reduced potency compared to purified T cells.
* **Specificity**
    * Killing only occurred when target cells expressed GPRC5D
    * GPRC5D knockout abolished activity, BCMA knockout did not.
*   **In Vivo Activity:**
    *   JNJ-64407564 prevents tumor growth in prophylactic NCI-H929 xenograft models.
    *   JNJ-64407564 induces tumor regression in established MM.1S xenograft models.
    *   JNJ-64407564 shows antitumor activity in a humanized NOG mouse model.
    *   Treatment is associated with increased T-cell infiltration into tumors.
*  **Gene expression studies**
    * JNJ-64407564 upregulated immune activation genes.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

GPRC5D is a promising target for immunotherapy in MM due to its restricted expression and cell surface localization. JNJ-64407564, a bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D and CD3, demonstrates potent anti-myeloma activity *in vitro* and *in vivo* by redirecting T cells to kill GPRC5D-expressing MM cells. The study supports the clinical development of JNJ-64407564 for the treatment of MM.
