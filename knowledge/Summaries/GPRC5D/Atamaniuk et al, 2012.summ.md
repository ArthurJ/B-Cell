# Overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor 5D in the bone marrow is associated with poor prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma

**Original Abstract:**
**Background** G protein-coupled receptor 5D (GPRC5D) is a novel surface receptor. As this new subtype of G
protein-coupled receptors was discovered, little is known about the role of this gene.
**Materials and methods** In this retrospective study, we investigated GPRC5D mRNA expression by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) of 48 patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
**Results** Highly variable levels of GPRC5D (median, 288; quartiles, 17–928) were detected in patients with MM,
whereas only low expression was detected in normal tissues (median, 1; quartiles, 1–23). High mRNA expres-
sion of GPRC5D correlated positively with high plasma cell count in bone marrow (r = 0Æ64, P < 0Æ001), high b2-
microglobulin (r = 0Æ42, P = 0Æ003) and poor-risk cytogenetics: deletion 13q14 (rb-1), P = 0Æ003; and 14q32 trans-
location t(4;14)(p16;q32), P = 0Æ029. GPRC5D mRNA expression showed a significant correlation with overall
survival (P = 0Æ031). The estimated overall survival of patients expressing GPRC5D above or below the median
of 288 was 43Æ9% vs. 70Æ2% at 48 months. Here, we report, for the first time, the association of GPRC5D
expression and cancer.
**Conclusions** Overexpression in poor-risk myeloma, low expression in normal tissues and cell surface expres-
sion identify GPRC5D as a potential novel cancer antigen. Our data demonstrate that GPRC5D is a prognostic
factor in MM correlating with other major risk factors.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This *retrospective* study investigates the mRNA expression of G protein-coupled receptor 5D (GPRC5D) in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and its correlation with clinical and prognostic factors.

---

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

*   **Patient Samples:** Bone marrow samples from 48 patients with MM.
*   **Control Samples:** Bone marrow from 10 healthy donors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 healthy volunteers, various normal tissues, and several cancer cell lines.
*   **RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis:** Standard methods were used to extract RNA and synthesize cDNA.
*   **Real-Time PCR:** GPRC5D mRNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR, with β-actin as an endogenous control.  Expression levels were normalized relative to PBMC samples from healthy controls.
*   **Interphase Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH):** Used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, specifically deletion 13q14 (del rb-1) and 14q translocations [t(14q)].  Probes specific for t(11;14) and t(4;14) were also used.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate associations between continuous variables.
    *   Wilcoxon's rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare GPRC5D levels between groups.
    *   Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests were used for survival analysis.
    *   Univariate and multi-variable proportional hazards Cox models were applied to the survival data.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **GPRC5D Overexpression in MM:** GPRC5D mRNA levels were highly variable in MM patients, spanning four orders of magnitude, with a median value of 288 (relative to control PBMCs).
*   **Low Expression in Normal Tissues:** GPRC5D expression was very low in normal bone marrow and most other normal tissues tested (highest in testis). No expression was found in several tested tissues, including brain. No expression was found in tested cell lines.
*   **Correlation with Clinical Parameters:** Higher GPRC5D mRNA expression was significantly correlated with:
    *   Higher plasma cell count in the bone marrow.
    *   Higher β2-microglobulin levels.
    *   Poor-risk cytogenetics: deletion 13q14 (del rb-1) and t(4;14) translocation.
*   **Prognostic Significance:** High GPRC5D expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS). Patients with GPRC5D expression above the median had an estimated OS of 43.9% at 48 months, compared to 70.2% for patients with expression below the median.
* **Subgroup analysis**: The effect of GPRC5D on survival persisted withing the subgroup of patients with del 13q14.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

GPRC5D is overexpressed in the bone marrow of MM patients, particularly those with poor-risk disease characteristics.  High GPRC5D expression is a negative prognostic factor for overall survival.  The authors propose GPRC5D as a potential novel cancer antigen and a prognostic marker in MM, warranting further investigation.

**5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS**

*   **Novel Finding:** This is the first report of an association between GPRC5D and cancer.
*   **Prognostic Marker:**  GPRC5D mRNA expression is a potential prognostic marker in MM, correlating with established risk factors.
*   **Potential Therapeutic Target:**  The restricted expression pattern (high in MM, low in normal tissues) and cell surface localization suggest GPRC5D could be a therapeutic target.
*   **Limitations:** The study is retrospective and includes a relatively small number of patients (n=48).  Protein expression and functional studies are needed to confirm the findings and explore the role of GPRC5D in MM pathogenesis. No data on the protein level.
* **Key Concepts:**
    *   **GPRC5D:** G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D, an orphan receptor (ligand unknown).
    *   **Multiple Myeloma (MM):**  A cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.
    *   **Real-Time PCR:** A quantitative method for measuring mRNA expression.
    *   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization):** A technique for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.
    *   **Prognostic Factor:**  A factor that predicts the likely course or outcome of a disease.
    * **Overall Survival:** The percentage of people still alive at a set amount of time.
