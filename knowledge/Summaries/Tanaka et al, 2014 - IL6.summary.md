**Title**: IL-6 in Inflammation, Immunity, and Disease

**Abstract**: Interleukin 6 (IL-6), promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and tissue injuries, contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions. Although its expression is strictly controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, dysregulated continual synthesis of IL-6 plays a pathological effect on chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. For this reason, tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was developed. Various clinical trials have since shown the exceptional efficacy of tocilizumab, which resulted in its approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Moreover, tocilizumab is expected to be effective for other intractable immune-mediated diseases. In this context, the mechanism for the continual synthesis of IL-6 needs to be elucidated to facilitate the development of more specific therapeutic approaches and analysis of the pathogenesis of specific diseases.

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Main Research Objective

### Primary Discoveries
1. IL-6 Regulation and Function:
   - Rapidly produced in response to infection/injury
   - Controlled by complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms
   - Functions through membrane-bound and soluble receptors

2. Disease Mechanisms:
   - Dysregulated IL-6 production leads to chronic inflammation
   - Plays crucial role in autoimmune disease development
   - Affects multiple biological processes including acute phase response and T-cell differentiation

3. Therapeutic Applications:
   - Tocilizumab effectively blocks IL-6 signaling
   - Proven effective for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis
