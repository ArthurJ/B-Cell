### 1. OVERVIEW
This poster reports the long-term efficacy and safety of talquetamab from the Phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 study. The central question is whether the deep and durable responses to this first-in-class GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody are maintained with extended follow-up (30-38 months) in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Given that RRMM is an incurable disease with limited options for heavily pretreated patients, this long-term data is critical for establishing talquetamab's role in the treatment landscape and understanding its sustained benefit and safety profile over time.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This study presents an extended follow-up analysis of the open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 clinical trial. The analysis included patients with RRMM who received subcutaneous talquetamab at two recommended Phase 2 doses: 0.4 mg/kg weekly (QW; n=143) or 0.8 mg/kg every other week (Q2W; n=154). A separate cohort consisted of patients who had received prior T-cell redirection therapy (TCR; n=78). Efficacy was evaluated based on overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The safety profile, including adverse events (AEs) like infections and GPRC5D-related toxicities, was also assessed.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Talquetamab elicits high and durable responses with long-term follow-up.** At a median follow-up of approximately 30-38 months, overall response rates remained high: 74.1% in the weekly (QW) cohort, 69.5% in the every-other-week (Q2W) cohort, and 66.7% in the prior T-cell redirection therapy (TCR) cohort. A significant proportion of patients achieved a complete response or better (Figure 1).
*   **The every-other-week (Q2W) dosing regimen demonstrated superior long-term outcomes.** Compared to the QW regimen, the Q2W regimen resulted in a longer median duration of response (17.5 vs. 9.5 months) and median progression-free survival (11.2 vs. 7.5 months), suggesting greater durability with less frequent dosing (Poster Table).
*   **Long-term overall survival (OS) is promising, particularly with the Q2W schedule.** At 36 months, the estimated OS rate was 60.8% for the Q2W cohort, and the median OS was not reached. For the QW cohort, the 36-month OS rate was 49.3% with a median OS of 34.0 months. These results indicate a substantial long-term survival benefit in this heavily pretreated population (Figure 3).
*   **The safety profile remains manageable over time with no new significant concerns.** The extended follow-up did not reveal new safety signals. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events remained low, and no new discontinuations due to GPRC5D-related AEs were reported. The risk of new-onset severe (Grade ≥3) infections was primarily confined to the early treatment cycles (Figure 5).
*   **Initial weight loss, a GPRC5D-related AE, tended to stabilize or improve over time.** Patients, particularly those with a healthy baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) who remained on treatment, experienced an initial mean weight loss that subsequently stabilized and trended back toward baseline, indicating that this side effect is most prominent early in therapy (Figure 4).

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
With the longest follow-up for any GPRC5D-targeting agent, talquetamab demonstrates sustained deep and durable responses and promising long-term overall survival in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM. The safety profile is consistent and manageable over time, with a notably lower risk of high-grade infections compared to other immunotherapies. The every-other-week dosing schedule appears to provide more durable outcomes. These findings reinforce talquetamab's position as a valuable and versatile therapeutic option for RRMM.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** A first-in-class bispecific antibody that targets GPRC5D on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells to redirect the immune system to kill cancer cells.
    *   **Long-Term Durability:** The persistence of a treatment's effectiveness over an extended period, measured by metrics like duration of response and overall survival.
    *   **GPRC5D-Related Adverse Events:** A unique set of side effects (e.g., skin/nail changes, oral toxicities like dysgeusia, weight loss) caused by the on-target, off-tumor activity of talquetamab in GPRC5D-expressing healthy tissues.
    *   **Humoral Immune Preservation:** A key safety feature of talquetamab, which spares normal B-cells and plasma cells, leading to lower rates of severe infection compared to therapies targeting antigens like BCMA.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Bispecific Antibody (BsAb):** An artificial antibody that can simultaneously bind to two different types of antigens. Talquetamab binds to GPRC5D on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells.
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D):** A protein highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, making it a specific target for therapy.
    *   **RRMM (Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma):** Myeloma that has returned after treatment or has become resistant to it, representing an advanced and difficult-to-treat stage of the disease.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This study provides the longest-term follow-up data (30-38 months) for a GPRC5D-targeting therapy, confirming the durability of talquetamab's efficacy and safety.
    *   It demonstrates superior long-term outcomes with the every-other-week (Q2W) dosing schedule, providing important evidence for clinical practice.
    *   The data reinforce the favorable safety profile of talquetamab, particularly its B-cell sparing nature, which contributes to a lower risk of severe infections and highlights its potential for use in combination therapies.
