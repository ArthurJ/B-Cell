# Consensus Guidelines for Infection Prevention in Multiple Myeloma

## ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION

**Original Title:** Consensus guidelines and recommendations for infection prevention in multiple myeloma: a report from the International Myeloma Working Group

**Original Abstract:** Infection remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma because of the cumulative effect of disease, treatment, and host-related factors. Given that infectious risk is cumulative through the course of the disease, preventing infections is paramount. Optimal preventive strategies include vaccination against common pathogens, antimicrobial prophylaxis, infection control measures, and immunoglobulin replacement in a small subset of patients; however, there are no universally accepted guidelines for infection prevention. This Review provides a consensus statement from a panel of 36 experts with global representation, which was convened by The International Myeloma Society to review existing literature and current guidelines, address issues associated with the risk of infection and prevention of infectious complications in multiple myeloma in the context of emerging therapies, and offer recommendations for preventing these complications.

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main Research Objective:**  
To establish consensus guidelines for preventing infectious complications in multiple myeloma patients through expert panel recommendations.

**Central Question/Problem:**  
How to effectively prevent and manage infections in multiple myeloma patients given the lack of universally accepted guidelines?

**Context and Relevance:**
- Infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in multiple myeloma
- Approximately 10% of newly diagnosed patients die prematurely due to infections
- Current therapies have transformed myeloma into a chronic condition with multiple relapses
- Need for comprehensive infection prevention strategies has increased with new therapeutic approaches

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General Approach:**
- Panel of 36 global experts in multiple myeloma and infectious disease
- Review of existing literature and current guidelines
- Development of consensus recommendations using NCCN criteria

**Specific Tools and Methods:**
- NCCN criteria for grading recommendations:
  - Category 1: High-level evidence with uniform consensus
  - Category 2A: Lower-level evidence with uniform consensus
  - Category 2B: Lower-level evidence with consensus but not universal

**Analyzed Data:**
- Review of existing guidelines from:
  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  - Infectious Disease Society of America
  - National Comprehensive Cancer Network
- Literature review of infection risks and prevention strategies
- Clinical trial data and real-world evidence

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary Discoveries:**

1. Risk Factors for Infection:
- Disease-related immune dysfunction
- Treatment-related immunosuppression
- Host factors (age, comorbidities)
- Highest risk periods: first 3 months after diagnosis and during relapsed/refractory disease

2. Prevention Strategies:
- Vaccination recommendations for key pathogens
- Risk-adapted antimicrobial prophylaxis
- Infection control measures
- Selective use of immunoglobulin replacement

3. Treatment-Specific Risks:
- Detailed analysis of infection risks with various therapies
- Guidelines for prophylaxis based on treatment type
- Recommendations for monitoring and prevention

4. Special Considerations:
- Travel recommendations
- Post-exposure prophylaxis
- Management of specific pathogens

**Practical Implications:**
- Clear guidelines for infection prevention based on patient risk factors
- Specific recommendations for prophylaxis during different treatment phases
- Frameworks for vaccination timing and effectiveness
- Protocols for managing high-risk situations

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

**General Conclusions:**
- Infection prevention requires individualized, risk-adapted approaches
- Comprehensive prevention strategies should include multiple interventions
- Timing of interventions is crucial for effectiveness

**Practical Applications:**
- Detailed recommendations for:
  - Antimicrobial prophylaxis
  - Vaccination protocols
  - Monitoring strategies
  - Risk assessment

**Study Limitations:**
- Limited high-level evidence for some recommendations
- Rapid evolution of therapy options requiring updated guidelines
- Variable resources and practices across different regions
- Exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 specific guidelines
