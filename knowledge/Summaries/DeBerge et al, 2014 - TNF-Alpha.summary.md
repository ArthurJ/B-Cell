**Original Abstract:**
TNF-α is a pleotropic cytokine, which has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions during influenza infection. TNF-α is first expressed as a transmembrane (mem) protein that is proteolytically processed to release a soluble (sol) form. memTNF-α and solTNF-α have been shown to exert distinct tissue-protective or -pathologic effects in several disease models. However, the relative contributions of memTNF-α or solTNF-α in regulating pulmonary immunopathology following influenza infection are unclear. Therefore, we performed intranasal influenza infection in mice exclusively expressing non-cleavable memTNF-α or lacking TNF-α entirely and examined the outcomes. We found that solTNF-α, but not memTNF-α, was required to limit the size of the immune response and the extent of injury. In the absence of solTNF-α, there was a significant increase in the CD8+ T-cell response, including virus-specific CD8+ T-cells, which was due in part to an increased resistance to activation-induced cell death. We found that solTNF-α mediates these immunoregulatory effects primarily through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), since mice deficient in TNFR1, but not TNFR2, exhibited dysregulated immune responses and exacerbated injury similar to that observed in mice lacking solTNF-α. We also found that solTNF-α expression was required early during infection to regulate the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response indicating that early inflammatory events are critical for the regulation of the effector phase. Taken together, these findings suggest that processing of memTNF-α to release solTNF-α is a critical event regulating the immune response during influenza infection.

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main Research Objective:**  
To understand the distinct roles of membrane-bound TNF-α (memTNF-α) and soluble TNF-α (solTNF-α) in regulating immune responses during influenza infection.

**Central Question/Problem:**  
What are the relative contributions of memTNF-α and solTNF-α in regulating pulmonary immunopathology during influenza infection?

**Context and Relevance:**
- TNF-α plays dual roles in inflammation during influenza infection
- Understanding the specific functions of different TNF-α forms is crucial for therapeutic targeting
- Previous studies had not distinguished between the roles of membrane-bound versus soluble TNF-α
- Findings have implications for treatment strategies in influenza and other inflammatory conditions

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General Approach:**
- Use of mouse models with genetic modifications of TNF-α expression
- Intranasal influenza infection experiments
- Comparative analysis of immune responses and tissue damage

**Specific Tools and Methods:**
- Mouse models:
  * Wild-type C57BL/6 mice
  * Mice expressing non-cleavable memTNF-α (memTNFΔ1–9, K11E KI)
  * TNF-α knockout mice (TNF−/−)
  * TNFR1−/− and TNFR2−/− mice
- Flow cytometry for immune cell analysis
- Histological examination of lung tissue
- Cytokine and chemokine analysis
- Viral titer measurements
- T cell functional assays

**Analyzed Data/Samples:**
- Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
- Lung tissue samples
- Mediastinal lymph nodes
- Blood oxygen saturation
- Body weight measurements
- Viral load measurements

**Methodological Innovations:**
- Use of mice exclusively expressing non-cleavable memTNF-α
- Temporal analysis of TNF-α requirements during infection
- Combined analysis of both immune response and tissue damage

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary Discoveries:**

1. Main Findings Addressing Central Question:
- solTNF-α, but not memTNF-α, is essential for limiting immune response magnitude
- solTNF-α regulates CD8+ T-cell responses primarily through TNFR1
- Early solTNF-α expression is crucial for controlling later immune responses

2. Key Results:
- Mice lacking solTNF-α showed:
  * Increased CD8+ T-cell responses
  * Enhanced immune cell infiltration
  * Greater lung tissue damage
  * Reduced oxygen saturation
- TNFR1-deficient mice displayed similar phenotype to solTNF-α-deficient mice
- Viral clearance was not impaired in any experimental group

3. Secondary Relevant Findings:
- Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-15) in absence of solTNF-α
- Enhanced chemokine production (CCL2, CXCL10) without solTNF-α
- CD8+ T cells showed resistance to activation-induced cell death in absence of solTNF-α

4. Unexpected Results:
- memTNF-α alone was insufficient for immune regulation
- TNFR2-deficient mice showed reduced tissue injury compared to controls

**Practical Implications:**
- Therapeutic targeting of specific TNF-α forms may be beneficial
- Timing of TNF-α intervention is crucial for treatment success
- Need for careful consideration in anti-TNF-α therapy design

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

**General Conclusions:**
1. solTNF-α is the critical form for immune regulation during influenza infection
2. Processing of memTNF-α to solTNF-α is essential for limiting immunopathology
3. Early inflammatory events shape the later immune response
4. TNFR1 is the primary mediator of solTNF-α's immunoregulatory effects

**Practical Applications:**
