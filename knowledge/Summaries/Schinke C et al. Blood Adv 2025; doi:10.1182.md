**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Infections and parameters of humoral immunity with talquetamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in MonumenTAL-1
*   **Original Abstract:** Talquetamab is the first approved GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) based on results from the phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 study (NCT03399799/NCT04634552). We report the infection profile among patients treated with talquetamab in MonumenTAL-1. Patients with triple-class exposed RRMM received subcutaneous talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly (QW) or 0.8 mg/kg every other week (Q2W). Patients with prior T-cell redirection therapy (TCR) were included in a separate cohort and received either schedule. Infections (graded by CTCAE v4.03) were managed per local guidelines. Patients received talquetamab (N = 339) with a median follow-up of 18.8 (QW; n = 143), 12.7 (Q2W; n = 145), and 14.8 (prior TCR; n = 51) months. Infections occurred in 58.7%, 66.2%, and 72.5% of patients, respectively; most common were respiratory infections including COVID-19. Grade 3/4 infections occurred in 21.7% (QW), 15.9% (Q2W), and 27.5% (prior TCR) of patients, onset most common in cycles 1/2. Opportunistic infections were low (3.5%, 5.5%, and 5.9%, respectively). Five patients died due to infections. Neutrophil levels recovered at cycle 2 and were maintained throughout treatment. B cell levels remained stable in early cycles with notable increases at cycle 7. Immunoglobulin G levels recovered after cycle 3 and increased through cycle 17. Few patients started IVIG following talquetamab (9.8% [QW], 6.9% [Q2W], and 5.9% [prior TCR]). Patients treated with talquetamab demonstrated relatively low rates of grade 3/4 infections and preservation of humoral immunity, distinguishing talquetamab as an important and potentially less immunosuppressive, novel treatment option for patients with RRMM.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This study's main objective was to characterize the infection profile and impact on humoral immunity of talquetamab, a GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody, in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The central problem addressed is the high risk of infection associated with immunotherapies in myeloma. This research is clinically relevant as it evaluates the safety of talquetamab, suggesting it may be a less immunosuppressive option compared to other T-cell redirecting therapies by assessing its effects on B cells, immunoglobulins, and infection rates from the pivotal MonumenTAL-1 clinical trial.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
The study was a post hoc analysis of data from 339 patients enrolled in the Phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 trial. Patients with heavily pretreated RRMM received subcutaneous talquetamab either weekly (0.4 mg/kg QW) or every other week (0.8 mg/kg Q2W). A separate cohort had received prior T-cell redirection therapy. The analysis focused on the incidence, type, severity (graded by CTCAE v4.03), and timing of infections. Key parameters of humoral immunity, including CD19+ B-cell counts and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, were monitored longitudinally via flow cytometry and laboratory tests. Hematologic parameters like neutrophil counts were also tracked. COVID-19 vaccination response was assessed in a small real-world sub-cohort.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Talquetamab was associated with relatively low rates of severe infections.** While any-grade infections occurred in 58.7% to 72.5% of patients across cohorts, severe (Grade 3/4) infections were less common, occurring in 15.9% (Q2W cohort), 21.7% (QW cohort), and 27.5% (prior TCR cohort). The risk of severe infection was highest in the first two cycles and declined thereafter.
*   **Opportunistic infections and infection-related deaths were rare.** The rates of opportunistic infections were low across all groups (3.5%–5.9%). In total, only five patients (1.5%) out of 339 died due to infections, indicating a manageable safety profile in this heavily pretreated population.
*   **Treatment was B-cell sparing and allowed for recovery of humoral immunity.** Unlike many other myeloma immunotherapies, talquetamab did not deplete B cells; CD19+ B-cell levels remained stable and began increasing by cycle 7 (Figure 4). Furthermore, polyclonal IgG levels recovered after an initial dip and increased above baseline by cycle 17 (Figure 5), with a low proportion of patients requiring IVIG support.
*   **Hematologic recovery was rapid and sustained.** Although neutropenia was common in the first cycle, neutrophil counts recovered quickly by cycle 2 and were maintained throughout treatment (Figure 3). This rapid recovery of hematopoiesis contrasts with the prolonged cytopenias seen with some other immunotherapies. Patients also maintained the ability to mount antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
Treatment with talquetamab demonstrates effective myeloma control with a manageable infection profile and concurrent preservation of key humoral immune functions. The therapy is B-cell sparing, allowing for the recovery of cytopenias, maintenance of polyclonal IgG, and robust vaccine responses. These findings distinguish talquetamab as an important and potentially less immunosuppressive novel treatment option for patients with RRMM, especially when compared to BCMA-targeting agents. The study's main limitation is its single-arm design, which precludes direct comparisons with other therapies and makes it difficult to distinguish drug effects from disease-related factors.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** A first-in-class bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to kill myeloma cells by targeting GPRC5D on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells.
    *   **Humoral Immunity:** The component of the immune system that involves antibodies produced by B cells and plasma cells, crucial for fighting infections.
    *   **B-cell Sparing Therapy:** A treatment that achieves its anti-cancer effect without significantly depleting the body's normal B-cell population, thereby preserving a critical part of the immune system.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **GPRC5D:** A novel cell surface receptor (G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D) that is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells but has limited expression on normal tissues, making it an ideal therapeutic target.
    *   **Bispecific Antibody:** An engineered protein that can bind to two different targets simultaneously, in this case, linking a T cell to a cancer cell to induce targeted killing.
    *   **RRMM (Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma):** Multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of remission or has stopped responding to standard treatments.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the infection profile for a GPRC5D-targeting therapy, demonstrating a favorable safety profile with low rates of severe and opportunistic infections.
    *   It establishes talquetamab as a B-cell sparing immunotherapy, a significant advantage over BCMA-targeting therapies which often cause B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia.
    *   The findings support that targeting GPRC5D allows for rapid hematologic recovery and preservation of humoral immunity, making talquetamab a valuable and potentially safer option for heavily pretreated myeloma patients.
