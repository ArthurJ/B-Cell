**METHODS**

**1. Mice:**

*   Male and female mice, 8–16 weeks old.
*   Strains:
    *   C57BL/6 (B6, CD45.2+)
    *   B6 Ly5.2 (CD45.1+)
    *   CD19 KO mice (on B6 background)
    *   Blimp1mVenus AIDCre/+ Rosa26tdTomato (BAT mice: created by crossing)
    *  Ub-GFP
    * Rosa26-tdTomato
    * Rosa26-stop-YFP

**2. Viruses:**

*   Influenza A virus: A/HK-x31 (X31, H3N2)
*   Reporter strains: CFP-S-Flu, GFP-S-Flu (expressing CFP or GFP, respectively)
* Viruses were cloned, and propagated.

**3. Influenza Infection, Rechallenge, and Immunization:**

*   **Primary Infection:** Intranasal (i.n.) administration of 2x10^4 PFU of X31 in PBS (under anesthesia).
*   **Rechallenge:** High-dose challenge with 1x10^6 PFU of X31 or CFP-S-Flu.
* **Immunization:** With Sheep Red Blood Cells, or Virus-Like Particles.

**4. Antibody Treatments and Cell Depletion:**

*   **Alveolar Macrophage Depletion:** Intranasal clodronate-loaded liposomes (CLL) administered on days -6 and -3 before rechallenge.
*   **Anti-CD40L:**  250 μg administered intravenously every 2 days for 10 days (starting day 28 post-infection).
*   **Anti-CXCR3:** Single 500 μg dose intravenously 24 hours before rechallenge.
*   **Anti-IFNγ:**  100 μg intravenously 24 hours before rechallenge and 1 hour following rechallenge.
* **Pertussis Toxin**: Intravenously 2h after re-challenge
* **FTY720:** 1mg/kg in PBS 2 days prior to rechallenge.

**5. Adoptive Cell Transfer:**

*   CD19+ B cells were purified from BAT splenocytes and transferred intravenously into CD19 KO mice.

**6. Live Explant Imaging:**

*   Lungs were inflated with low-melt agarose.
*   Individual lobes were dissected and sectioned (450 μm) using a vibratome.
*   Sections were mounted on coverslips and imaged using a two-photon microscope (Zeiss LSM 880).
*   Multiple Z-planes were acquired every 15-30 seconds.
* Image Analysis: IMARIS

**7. Imaging of Static Lung Sections (TPLSM):**

*  Similar to live imaging, but larger, tiled images.

**8. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy:**
    * Standard procedures.

**9. Flow Cytometry:**

*   Cells were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32.
*   Stained with various antibodies (see Key Resources Table for details).
*   Analyzed using FACS Calibur, FACS Canto, or LSR Fortessa flow cytometers.
* Data analysis with FlowJo.

**10. Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Seq:**

* Sorted B-cell populations
* Library construction and sequencing
* Data analysis and normalization.

**11. Quantitative PCR (qPCR):**

*   RNA isolation.
*   cDNA synthesis.
*   Real-time PCR using TaqMan assays.
*   Gene expression normalized to GAPDH.

**12. ELISA:**

*   Used to measure antibody levels (anti-influenza IgG, anti-hamster IgG) and albumin levels in BAL fluid.

**KEY RESOURCES TABLE**
This table, provided in the original paper, lists:

*   **Antibodies:** A comprehensive list of antibodies used for flow cytometry, including clone names, fluorochromes, and vendors.
*   **Bacterial and Virus Strains:** X31 influenza, CFP-S-Flu, GFP-S-Flu.

*   **Critical Commercial Assays:** Cytofix/Cytoperm, MagniSort Mouse B cell Enrichment Kit.
* **Experimental models**: Mouse models
*  **Oligonucleotides**: List of primers.
*   **Software and Algorithms:** FlowJo, GraphPad Prism, Adobe Illustrator, Imaris, Zen, R Studio.
