# B cells and the coordination of immune checkpoint inhibitor response in patients with solid tumors

**Abstract:** (Provided verbatim)

Immunotherapy profoundly changed the landscape of cancer therapy by providing long-lasting responses in subsets of patients and is now the standard of care in several solid tumor types. However, immunotherapy activity beyond conventional immune checkpoint inhibition is plateauing, and biomarkers are overall lacking to guide treatment selection. Most studies have focused on T cell engagement and response, but there is a growing evidence that B cells may be key players in the establishment of an organized immune response, notably through tertiary lymphoid structures. Mechanisms of B cell response include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, promotion of CD41 andCD81 T cell activation, maintenance of antitumor immune memory. In several solid tumor types, higher levels of B cells, specific B cell subpopulations, or the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures have been associated with improved outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors. The fate of B cell subpopulations may be widely influenced by the cytokine milieu, with versatile roles for B-specific cytokines B cell activating factor and B cell attracting chemokine-1/ CXCL13, and a master regulatory role for IL-10. Roles of B cell-specific immune checkpoints such as TIM-1 are emerging and could represent potential therapeutic targets. Overall, the expanding field of B cells in solid tumors of holds promise for the improvement of current immunotherapy strategies and patient selection.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article focuses on the emerging roles of B cells in the context of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While most research has emphasized T cells, B cells are increasingly recognized as important players in the anti-tumor immune response. The review examines how B cells contribute to this response, how they can be used as biomarkers, and potential future research and applications.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

This is a review; no original experimental methods are presented. It synthesizes previous studies with a variety of methodologies:

*   **Human Studies:**  Analysis of patient samples (tumor tissue, blood) from patients treated with ICIs and other therapies.
*   **Animal models:**  Various models of cancers, to examine B cell function in vivo.
*   **In vitro studies:**  Cell culture experiments.
*   **Molecular Biology and Immunology Techniques:**  Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, gene expression analysis (including RNA sequencing), etc.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **B Cells and Anti-Tumor Immunity:** B cells can contribute to anti-tumor immunity through several mechanisms:
    *   **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Phagocytosis (ADCP):**  Antibodies produced by B cells can opsonize tumor cells, leading to their destruction by NK cells, macrophages, and other immune cells.
    *   **Antigen Presentation:**  B cells can act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), activating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
    *   **Cytokine Production:**  B cells can produce cytokines that modulate the immune response (both pro- and anti-inflammatory).
    *   **Formation of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS):**  B cells are often found within TLS, organized structures within the tumor that resemble secondary lymphoid organs.  TLS presence is often associated with improved prognosis and response to ICIs.
*   **B Cells as Predictive Biomarkers:**
    *   **B Cell Infiltration and TLS:**  Higher levels of B cell infiltration and the presence of mature TLS in tumor tissue have been associated with better outcomes (response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival) in various cancers treated with ICIs, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and sarcoma.
    *   **Circulating B Cells:**  Some studies have found associations between specific circulating B cell subsets (e.g., memory B cells) and response to ICIs, but results are less consistent than for tissue-based markers.
    *   **B Cell Signatures:**  Gene expression signatures related to B cells have also been linked to improved outcomes with ICIs.
    * **Plasma Cells:** Presence of plasma cells, and tumor-direct antibodies are associated with better outcomes.
    *  **Antibody Secreting Cells:** Have been correlated with favorable patient outcomes.
*   **B Cell-Specific Checkpoints:**  TIM-1 is an emerging B cell-specific checkpoint that could be a potential therapeutic target.
* **B-Cells and Cytokines:**
    *  B-cell populations are influenced by cytokines.
    *  **BCA-1/CXCL13**: Important for B cell recruitment, but its prognostic/predictive role is complex and may vary by cancer type.
    *  **BAFF**: Can have both pro- and anti-tumor effects, and its role in ICI response is unclear.
    *  **IL-10**: Master regulator; has both immune suppressive, and stimulatory effects.
*   **B Cells and Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs):**  B cells may play a role in the development of irAEs associated with ICI therapy, potentially through autoantibody production or altered cytokine production.
*   **B Cells as Therapeutic Targets:**
    *   **Adoptive B Cell Therapy:**  Using engineered B cells (e.g., CAR-B cells) is an emerging area of research.
    *   **Modulating B Cell Activity:**  Targeting B cell-specific checkpoints or cytokines could enhance anti-tumor immunity.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

B cells play diverse and important roles in the anti-tumor immune response, and their presence and activity within the tumor microenvironment can influence the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  B cells can act as both positive and negative regulators of immunity, highlighting the complexity of their involvement in cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which B cells contribute to anti-tumor immunity and to develop strategies for leveraging their potential in cancer immunotherapy.
