**1. OVERVIEW**
This review discusses T cell and B cell collaboration in the lung, contrasting the normal, systemic, immune responses with a localized response.

---

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**
As a review, it synthesizes other studies.

---

**3. KEY FINDINGS**
- The lung has physical barriers and local immune responses
- **iBALT**- Inducible Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue- is a structure analogous to germinal centers.
- **TFH cells**- T Follicular Helper cells-  provide growth, differentiation, and survival signals to B-cells.
- **TRH Cells**- T Resident Helper cells- similar to TFH, but localized to the lungs, not circulating. Express BCL6
- **BRM**- B Resident Memory cells- provide localized protection.
    - CXCR3+ BRM cells are important.
    - Alveolar macrophages are important for initial recruitment and location.
- **Original Antigenic Sin**: Prior exposure can limit the breadth of the immune response.

---

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**
T and B cells collaborate in the lungs to provide immunity.
