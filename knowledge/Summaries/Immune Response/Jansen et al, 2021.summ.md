# Regulatory B cells, A to Z

**Abstract:**

B cells play a central role in the immune system through the production of antibodies. During the past two decades, it has become increasingly clear that B cells also have the capacity to regulate immune responses through mechanisms that extend beyond antibody production. Several types of human and murine regulatory B cells have been reported that suppress inflammatory responses in autoimmune disease, allergy, infection, transplantation, and cancer. Key suppressive molecules associated with regulatory B-cell function include the cytokines IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β as well as cell membrane-bound molecules such as programmed death-ligand 1, CD39, CD73, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Regulatory B cells can be induced by a range of different stimuli, including microbial products such as TLR4 or TLR9 ligands, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-α, as well as CD40 ligation. This review provides an overview of our current knowledge on regulatory B cells. We discuss different types of regulatory B cells, the mechanisms through which they exert their regulatory functions, factors that lead to induction of regulatory B cells and their role in the alteration of inflammatory responses in different diseases.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article provides a comprehensive overview of regulatory B cells (Bregs), a subset of B cells with immunosuppressive functions. It discusses the history of Breg discovery, their diverse phenotypes and mechanisms of action, the factors that induce their development, and their roles in various diseases, including autoimmunity, allergy, infection, transplantation, and cancer.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

As a review, this article synthesizes existing research and does not present new experimental data. The studies cited used a wide range of methodologies:

*   **In vitro studies:** Human and murine B cell cultures, stimulated with various agents (e.g., LPS, CpG, CD40L, cytokines) to induce Breg differentiation and assess their suppressive functions.
*   **In vivo studies:** Mouse models of various diseases (e.g., EAE, arthritis, colitis, allergy, infection) to investigate the role of Bregs in disease pathogenesis and treatment.
*   **Human studies:** Analysis of B cell subsets and cytokine production in healthy individuals and patients with various diseases.
*   **Molecular biology techniques:** Flow cytometry, ELISA, gene expression analysis, etc.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **Breg Discovery:** The concept of regulatory B cells emerged from studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, showing that B cells could suppress immune responses in various disease models.
*   **Breg Heterogeneity:** Bregs are a diverse population of cells, with no single defining marker. Different Breg subsets have been identified based on varying surface markers, including:
    *   CD19+CD24hiCD38hi (transitional B cells)
    *   CD19+CD24hiCD27+
    *   CD19+CD5+CD1dhi (B10 cells)
    *   CD19+CD25hiCD71hiCD73- (Br1 cells)
    *   CD19+CD38+CD1d+IgM+CD147+ (GrB+ B cells)
    *   CD19+CD9+
    * CD138+ (plasma cells)
    *  And others
*   **Breg Mechanisms of Action:** Bregs suppress immune responses through multiple mechanisms:
    *   **Cytokine Production:** IL-10 (the most commonly associated cytokine), TGF-β, IL-35.
    *   **Cell-Cell Contact:** Interactions with T cells via PD-L1, FasL, CD40, etc.
    *   **Enzymatic Activity:** CD39 and CD73 convert ATP to adenosine, which has immunosuppressive effects.
    * **Other:** Granzyme B, IDO.
*   **Breg Induction:** Bregs can be induced by various stimuli:
    *   **Antigen-specific stimulation:** BCR engagement.
    *   **TLR ligands:** CpG (TLR9), LPS (TLR4).
    *   **Cytokines:** IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-α, IL-21, BAFF.
    *   **CD40 ligation:** Interaction with CD40L on T cells.
    * **Metabolic alterations**: short-chain fatty acids.
*   **Bregs in Disease:**
    *   **Autoimmune Diseases:** Bregs are often deficient or dysfunctional in autoimmune diseases like SLE, RA, and MS.
    *   **Allergy:** Bregs can suppress allergic responses. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) may work by inducing Bregs.
    *   **Infections:** Bregs can be beneficial (limiting inflammation) or detrimental (impairing pathogen clearance).
    *   **Cancer:** Bregs can promote tumor growth by suppressing anti-tumor immunity.
    *   **Transplantation:** Bregs can promote allograft tolerance.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

Regulatory B cells are a diverse population of immunosuppressive B cells that play important roles in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses.  Their dysfunction is implicated in various diseases.  Further research is needed to fully understand their development, function, and therapeutic potential.
