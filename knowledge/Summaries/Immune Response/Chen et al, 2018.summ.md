# Host Immune Response to Influenza A Virus Infection

**Abstract:** (Provided verbatim)

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are contagious pathogens responsible for severe respiratory infection in humans and animals worldwide. Upon detection of IAV infection, host immune system aims to defend against and clear the viral infection. Innate immune system is comprised of physical barriers (mucus and collectins), various phagocytic cells, group of cytokines, interferons (IFNs), and IFN-stimulated genes, which provide first line of defense against IAV infection. The adaptive immunity is mediated by B cells and T cells, characterized with antigen-specific memory cells, capturing and neutralizing the pathogen. The humoral immune response functions through hemagglutinin-specific circulating antibodies to neutralize IAV. In addition, antibodies can bind to the surface of infected cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement activation. Although there are neutralizing antibodies against the virus, cellular immunity also plays a crucial role in the fight against IAVs. On the other hand, IAVs have developed multiple strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we discuss how immune system, especially innate immune system and critical molecules are involved in the antiviral defense against IAVs. In addition, we highlight how IAVs antagonize different immune responses to achieve a successful infection.

**1. OVERVIEW**
This review summarizes the host immune response, particularly the innate immune response, to influenza A virus (IAV) infection.  It describes how the host detects IAV, the key immune cells and molecules involved in fighting the infection, and the various mechanisms IAV uses to evade the immune system.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

Being a review, this article presents no original experimental methods. The authors synthesize findings from prior research. Studies mentioned used a wide range of techniques:

*   **In vitro studies:** Experiments using cell lines and primary cells.
*   **In vivo studies:** Mouse models of IAV infection.
*   **Human studies:**  Analysis of patient samples, and observations during outbreaks.
*   **Molecular Biology**: gene cloning, protein interaction studies, gene expression analysis.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **IAV Structure and Entry:** IAV is an enveloped virus with a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.  Key surface proteins are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA binds to sialic acid (SA) receptors on host cells to initiate infection.
*   **Innate Immune Response:**
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Mucus traps viruses.
    *   **Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs):**
        *   RIG-I: Detects viral RNA in the cytoplasm.
        *   TLRs:  TLR3 (dsRNA), TLR7 (ssRNA), TLR8 (ssRNA) in endosomes.
    *   **Downstream Signaling:** PRR activation leads to activation of transcription factors (NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7) and production of type I (IFN-α, IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ) interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
    *   **Inflammasome:** NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to cytokine production (IL-1β, IL-18).
    *   **Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs):**  IFNs induce expression of hundreds of ISGs with antiviral activity, including:
        *   Mx proteins (inhibit viral replication)
        *   IFITMs (restrict viral entry)
        *   CH25H (produces 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks viral fusion)
        *   TRIM proteins (multiple antiviral mechanisms)
        *   ZAP, OAS-RNase L, PKR (inhibit viral mRNA expression and protein synthesis)
        *   Viperin, Tetherin
*   **Innate Immune Cells:**
    *   **Alveolar Macrophages:**  Phagocytose infected cells, limit viral spread, and regulate adaptive immunity.
    *   **Monocytes:** Recruited to the site of infection.
    *   **NK Cells:** Kill IAV-infected cells by recognizing HA via NKp44 and NKp46 receptors.
    *   **Dendritic Cells (DCs):**  Bridge innate and adaptive immunity; present viral antigens to T cells.
*   **Adaptive Immune Response:**
    *   **CD8+ T Cells (CTLs):**  Kill infected cells via perforin/granzyme and FasL/TRAIL pathways.
    *   **CD4+ T Cells:**  Provide help to B cells and CD8+ T cells; differentiate into various subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Tregs).
    *   **B Cells:** Produce antibodies that neutralize the virus (primarily targeting HA) or mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
* **Mucosal Immunity:**
    * Secretory IgA in upper respiratory tract.
    * NALT and BALT.
*   **IAV Evasion Strategies:**
    *   **HA and NA Mutations:** Antigenic drift and shift.
    *   **NS1:**  Major IFN antagonist; inhibits multiple steps in the IFN response, including RIG-I activation, PKR activation, and downstream signaling.
    *   **PB1-F2:**  Suppresses IFN responses by interacting with MAVS.
    *   **M2:** Interferes with autophagy.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

The host immune response to IAV is complex, involving multiple layers of innate and adaptive immunity. While the immune system has evolved to combat IAV, the virus has developed sophisticated mechanisms to evade these defenses. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.
