# Secreted IgM modulates IL-10 expression in B cells

**Abstract:** (Provided verbatim)

IL-10+ B cells are critical for immune homeostasis and restraining immune responses in infection, cancer, and inflammation; however, the signals that govern IL-10+ B cell differentiation are ill-defined. Here we find that IL-10+ B cells expand in mice lacking secreted IgM ((s)IgM–/–) up to 10-fold relative to wildtype (WT) among all major B-cell and regulatory B cell subsets. The IL-10+ B cell increase is polyclonal and presents within 24 hours of birth. In WT mice, sIgM is produced prenatally and limits the expansion of IL-10+ B cells. Lack of the high affinity receptor for sIgM, FcμR, in B cells translates into an intermediate IL-10+ B cell phenotype relative to WT or sIgM–/– mice. Our study thus shows that sIgM regulates IL-10 programming in B cells in part via B cell–expressed FcμR, thereby revealing a function of sIgM in regulating immune homeostasis.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This research article investigates the role of secreted IgM (sIgM) in regulating the development and function of IL-10-producing B cells (Bregs). The central finding is that the *absence* of sIgM leads to a significant *increase* in the number and proportion of IL-10+ B cells in mice. The study explores the timing, mechanism, and consequences of this regulation.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

*   **Mouse Models:**
    *   sIgM-/- mice (lacking secreted IgM).
    *   WT (wild-type) mice.
    *   IL-10GFP reporter mice (VertX7).
    *   FcμR-/- mice (lacking the high-affinity IgM receptor).
    *   FcμRB cell–/– (B cell specific knockout)
    *   CD19cre/WTFcmrfl/fl mice (B cell-specific FcμR knockout).
    *  Blimp-1GFP reporter mice.
    *   Mice with combined sIgM and IL-10 deficiencies.
    *   Heterozygous crosses to track sIgM-producing vs. non-producing B cells.
    * Adoptive transfer of B-cells.
*   **Flow Cytometry:**  Used extensively to quantify IL-10+ B cells and characterize B cell subsets (B-1, T1, T2, T2-MZP, MZ, FO, etc.) and Breg phenotypes (TIM1+, CD1dhiCD5+, CD9+).
*   **ELISA:**  Measured serum IgM and IL-10 levels.
*   **qPCR:**  Measured Il10 mRNA expression in various tissues.
*   **In Vitro B Cell Culture:**  Stimulation of B cells with anti-CD40, LPS, or other stimuli.
* **10x Genomics Single-Cell VDJ Sequencing** Performed on spleen cells.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**  Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, etc.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **sIgM Deficiency Leads to Increased IL-10+ B Cells:**  sIgM-/- mice had a significantly higher percentage and number of IL-10+ B cells in various tissues (spleen, lymph nodes) compared to WT mice.  This increase was observed across multiple B cell subsets, including both innate-like (B-1) and conventional (B-2) B cells.
*   **Early Onset:**  The increase in IL-10+ B cells in sIgM-/- mice was evident as early as 24 hours after birth, indicating a role for sIgM in early B cell development.
*   **sIgM is Produced Perinatally:** WT mice had detectable serum IgM levels prenatally and at birth.
*   **sIgM Acts Extrinsically:**  The expansion of IL-10+ B cells in sIgM-/- mice was due to the *absence* of sIgM in the environment, not an intrinsic defect in the B cells themselves.  Adoptive transfer experiments supported this.
*   **Role of FcμR:**  FcμR (the high-affinity IgM receptor) on B cells partially mediates the effect of sIgM.  FcμR-/- mice had an intermediate IL-10+ B cell phenotype between WT and sIgM-/- mice. B cell specific knockouts showed the same.
*   **Polyclonal Expansion:**  The increase in IL-10+ B cells in sIgM-/- mice was polyclonal, not due to the expansion of a specific clone.
*   **No Impact on Blimp-1:**  The increase in IL-10+ B cells in sIgM-/- mice was *not* due to increased Blimp-1 expression (a key transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation).
* **IL-10 increase present in multiple B-cell subsets:** Including FO, MZ, and B1 cells.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

Secreted IgM (sIgM) plays a crucial role in regulating the pool of IL-10+ B cells, acting extrinsically (i.e., on the B cells themselves) and partially through the FcμR.  The absence of sIgM leads to a significant expansion of IL-10+ B cells, starting very early in life.  This suggests that sIgM has a previously unappreciated role in maintaining immune homeostasis by limiting the development of IL-10+ regulatory B cells.
