# Methodologies Used in: The Multifaceted B Cell Response to Influenza Virus

**Overview:** This document summarizes the *methods* used in studies cited within the review article, "The Multifaceted B Cell Response to Influenza Virus," *not* the methods used by the review authors themselves (as it is a review).  The focus is on how researchers have studied B cell responses to influenza.

**I. General B Cell Analysis Techniques**

*   **Flow Cytometry:**  Widely used to identify and quantify B cell subsets based on surface markers (e.g., CD19, CD27, CD38, CD5, CD1d, IgM, IgG, IgA, and activation markers like CD69, CD80, PD-L2).  Also used to assess intracellular cytokine production.
*   **ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay):** Used to measure antibody levels (total and antigen-specific) in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cell culture supernatants. Also to measure cytokines.
* **ELISpot** Measures frequency of antibody-secreting cells.
*   **qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Used to measure mRNA expression of various genes, including cytokines, transcription factors, and B cell markers.
* **Microscopy**
    *   **Immunohistochemistry/Immunofluorescence:** Used to visualize B cells and other immune cells in tissues (e.g., lung, spleen, lymph nodes).  Can assess cell localization and interactions.
    *   **Confocal Microscopy:** For detailed imaging of cell interactions and localization.
    * **Multiphoton Microscopy:** intravital imaging.
    * **Electron Microscopy**
*   **B Cell Receptor (BCR) Sequencing:**  Used to analyze the diversity and mutation status of antibody genes (including somatic hypermutation analysis).  Both bulk sequencing and single-cell sequencing approaches are mentioned.
*   **B Cell Isolation/Purification:**  Various methods, including magnetic bead separation (e.g., using anti-CD19 beads), cell sorting (FACS).
* **Cell Culture** Various assays, culturing, stimulation, and anaylsis.
*   **Gene Expression Analysis:**  Microarrays, RNA sequencing (including single-cell RNA-seq) to assess gene expression profiles of different B cell subsets.
*   **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP):**  Used to study transcription factor binding to DNA.
* **Computational Modeling:** To understand B-cell development.

**II. Specific Assays and Models**

*   **Animal Models:**
    *   **Mice:**  Frequently used for influenza infection studies.  Genetically modified mice (knockouts, reporter mice) are common (e.g., Blimp-1 GFP reporter mice, mice deficient in specific cytokines or receptors).
    *   **Parabiosis:**  Surgical joining of two mice to study cell trafficking.
    *  **Chimeric mice:** For studying cell interactions
*   **Human Studies:**
    *   Analysis of blood samples (serum, PBMCs).
    *   Analysis of tissue samples (e.g., lung, tonsil, lymph node biopsies).
    *   Clinical trials of vaccines and immunotherapies.
*   **Viral Infection Models:**
    *   Influenza virus (various strains, including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9).
    *   Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    *   West Nile virus.
    *   Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).
    * HIV.
*   **Vaccination Models:**
    *   Influenza vaccines (inactivated, live-attenuated, subunit).
    *   Tetanus toxoid.
    *   Other vaccines.
*   **Antigen Presentation Assays:**
    *   *In vitro* stimulation of B cells with various antigens (e.g., viral proteins, peptides) and/or TLR ligands (e.g., CpG, LPS).
    *   Co-culture of B cells with T cells, dendritic cells, or other cell types.
    * Assessing cell surface markers.
*   **Cytotoxicity Assays:**
    *   Measuring the ability of B cells or T cells to kill target cells (e.g., infected cells or tumor cells).
* **Virus Assays**
    * Plaque assays
    * Hemaglutination
    * Neuraminidase assays

**III. Specific Experimental Manipulations**

*   **Genetic Modifications:**  Knockout mice, transgenic mice, reporter mice.
*   **Antibody Treatments:**  Neutralizing antibodies, depleting antibodies, blocking antibodies.
*   **Adoptive Transfer:**  Transfer of cells (e.g., B cells, T cells) from one mouse to another.
*   **Drug Treatments:**  Immunomodulatory drugs, inhibitors of specific signaling pathways.
*   **Adjuvant Use:**  Use of adjuvants (e.g., CpG, LPS) to enhance immune responses.
* **Live Imaging:** Imaging of live cells.
