# Antibody-independent functions of B cells during viral infections - Methods Summary

**Overview:** This document summarizes the *methods* used in studies cited within the review article "Antibody-independent functions of B cells during viral infections", *not* the methods used by the review authors themselves (as it is a review). It focuses on the experimental approaches used to study B cell functions beyond antibody production in the context of viral infections.

**I. GENERAL B CELL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES (Frequently Used)**

*   **Flow Cytometry:**  A core technique used throughout the cited studies. Used to:
    *   Identify and quantify B cell subsets based on surface markers (e.g., CD19, CD24, CD38, CD1d, CD5, CD27, IgM, IgD, and many others).
    *   Assess expression of activation markers (e.g., CD69, CD80, CD86, MHC class II).
    *   Measure intracellular cytokine production (e.g., IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6).
    *   Detect transcription factors (intracellular staining).
    *   Analyze cell proliferation.
*   **ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay):** Used to quantify cytokine levels and antibody levels in supernatants or serum.
*   **qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Used to measure mRNA expression of various genes.
*   **Microscopy:**
    *   Immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize cells and molecules in tissues.
*   **Cell Culture:**  *In vitro* stimulation of B cells with various agents (BCR cross-linking, TLR ligands, CD40L, cytokines, etc.) to assess their activation, differentiation, and cytokine production.
* **Cell Sorting**
* **Mass Cytometry**
*  **Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing**
* **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation**

**II. SPECIFIC ASSAYS AND MODELS**

*   **Mouse Models:**
    *   Genetically modified mice: Knockout mice (e.g., IL-10-/-, sIgM-/-, MyD88-/-, FcμR-/-), transgenic mice (e.g., expressing fluorescent reporters).
    *   Disease models:  Autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, arthritis), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a model for multiple sclerosis), colitis, viral infections.
    *   Adoptive transfer experiments: Transfer of specific B cell subsets or other cells into mice.
    *   Parabiosis: Surgical joining of two mice to study cell trafficking.
    *   Chimeric mice:  Mice with mixed populations of cells from different genetic backgrounds.
*   **Human Studies:**
    *   Analysis of blood samples (PBMCs, serum) from healthy individuals and patients with various diseases (e.g., autoimmune diseases, viral infections).
    *   Analysis of tissue samples (e.g., tonsils, spleen, lymph nodes).
* **Viral Infections Used (in cited studies):**
    *   Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)
    *   Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
    *   HIV
    *   Dengue virus
    *   Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).
    *   Friend retrovirus (FV)

    *   Rhinovirus

*   **Specific B Cell Stimulation/Activation Methods:**
    *   BCR cross-linking (e.g., with anti-IgM antibodies).
    *   TLR ligation (e.g., CpG for TLR9, LPS for TLR4).
    *   CD40 stimulation (e.g., with CD40L).
    *   Cytokine stimulation (e.g., IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-21, IFN-α, BAFF).
    *   Co-culture with other cell types (e.g., T cells, dendritic cells, stromal cells).

*   **Specific Assays to Assess B Cell Function:**
    *   Cytokine production (ELISA, intracellular staining).
    *   Proliferation assays.
    *   Antibody secretion assays.
    *   Antigen presentation assays (measuring T cell activation/proliferation).
    *   Suppression assays (measuring the ability of Bregs to suppress T cell responses).
    *   Apoptosis assays.
    *   Analysis of signaling pathways (e.g., phosphorylation of signaling molecules).
    *   Gene expression analysis (microarrays, RNA sequencing).
