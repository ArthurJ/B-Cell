# The inflammatory response triggered by Influenza virus: a two edged sword

**Abstract:**
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a relevant respiratory tract pathogen leading to a great number of deaths and hospitalizations worldwide. Secondary bacterial infections are a very common cause of IAV associated morbidity and mortality. The robust inflammatory response that follows infection is important for the control of virus proliferation but is also associated with lung damage, morbidity and death. The role of the different components of immune response underlying protection or disease during IAV infection is not completely elucidated. Overall, in the context of IAV infection, inflammation is a ‘double edge sword’ necessary to control infection but causing disease. Therefore, a growing number of studies suggest that immunomodulatory strategies may improve disease outcome without affecting the ability of the host to deal with infection. This review summarizes recent aspects of the inflammatory responses triggered by IAV that are preferentially involved in causing severe pulmonary disease and the anti-inflammatory strategies that have been suggested to treat influenza induced immunopathology.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review discusses the dual role of inflammation during influenza A virus (IAV) infection.  It highlights how inflammation is *essential* for controlling viral replication and clearing the infection, but *also* how excessive or dysregulated inflammation contributes to lung damage, morbidity, and mortality. The paper reviews the mechanisms of IAV recognition, the inflammatory mediators involved, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

As a review, the article does not present original experimental methods.  It synthesizes findings from previously published research, encompassing a wide range of approaches:

*   **In vivo studies:**  Mouse models of influenza infection, including different IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, etc.), knockout mice, and various treatment interventions.
*   **In vitro studies:**  Cell culture experiments with primary cells (e.g., alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes) and cell lines, stimulated with IAV or viral components.
*   **Human studies:**  Analysis of patient samples (e.g., serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue) during IAV infection, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials.
*   **Molecular biology and immunology techniques:**  ELISA, qPCR, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, gene expression analysis, etc.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **IAV Recognition and Innate Immunity:**
    *   IAV is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including:
        *   **TLRs:**  TLR3 (dsRNA), TLR7/8 (ssRNA) in endosomes.  TLR4 can also be activated by oxidized phospholipids.
        *   **RIG-I:**  Recognizes viral RNA in the cytoplasm.
        *   **NLRP3 inflammasome:**  Activated by viral RNA and other signals (e.g., M2 ion channel activity).
    *   PRR activation triggers signaling pathways (NF-κB, IRF3/7) leading to production of type I interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β) and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.

*   **Inflammatory Mediators:**
    *   **Cytokines:**  IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-22, IL-27, and others.
    *   **Chemokines:**  CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCL2, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL10 (IP-10), and others.
    *   **Lipid Mediators:**  Platelet-activating factor (PAF), leukotriene B4 (LTB4).
    * **Complement activation products**: C3a and C5a.

*   **Cellular Responses:**
    *   **Epithelial cells:**  Produce cytokines/chemokines, undergo apoptosis.
    *   **Alveolar macrophages:**  Early responders, phagocytose infected cells, produce cytokines.  Can polarize to M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 phenotypes.
    *   **Neutrophils:**  Recruited to the lungs, important for viral clearance but can also contribute to tissue damage.
    *   **NK cells:**  Contribute to viral control but can also have detrimental effects.
    *   **Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2):** Activated by IL-33, can have pathogenic roles, or promote tissue repair.
    *   **T cells (CD4+ and CD8+):**  Essential for adaptive immunity, but can also contribute to immunopathology.
    * **B-Cells**

*   **Dual Role of Inflammation:**
    *   **Protective:**  Inflammation is necessary to control viral replication and promote clearance.
    *   **Pathogenic:**  Excessive inflammation can lead to lung damage (e.g., edema, alveolar hemorrhage), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased mortality.

*   **Secondary Bacterial Infections:**  IAV infection often increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*).  Mechanisms include:
    *   Direct lung damage by the virus.
    *   Impaired innate immune defenses (e.g., reduced macrophage phagocytosis, neutrophil dysfunction).
    *   Increased expression of bacterial adhesion molecules.
* **Cytokine storm:**
    *  Linked to the severity of the disease.
    * Caused by excessive production of cytokines.

*   **Anti-inflammatory Strategies:**
    *   **Statins:**  Controversial results; some studies suggest benefit, others show no effect or harm.
    *   **COX-2 inhibitors:**  Some evidence of benefit in animal models, but clinical data are lacking.
    *   **PAF antagonists:**  Showed promise in preclinical studies.
    *   **CCR2 antagonists:**  Reduced lung injury in some models.
    *   **Other approaches:**  Targeting specific cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6), modulating lipid mediators, inhibiting inflammasome activation.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

Inflammation plays a crucial, but complex, dual role during influenza A virus infection.  It is essential for antiviral defense but can also contribute to severe lung injury and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.  Understanding the intricate balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators is critical for developing effective therapeutic strategies that can control the infection without exacerbating immunopathology.
