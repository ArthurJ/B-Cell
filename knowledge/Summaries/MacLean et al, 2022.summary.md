**Original Abstract**: Resident memory B (BRM) cells develop and persist in the lungs of influenza-infected mice and humans; however, their contribution to recall responses has not been defined. Here, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize BRM cells within the lungs of influenza-virus immune and reinfected mice. Prior to re-exposure, BRM cells were sparsely scattered throughout the tissue, displaying limited motility. Within 24h of rechallenge, these cells increased their migratory capacity, localized to infected sites, and subsequently differentiated into plasma cells. Alveolar macrophages mediated this process, in part by inducing expression of chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 from infiltrating inflammatory cells. This led to the recruitment of chemokine receptor CXCR3-expressing BRM cells to infected regions and increased local antibody concentrations. Our study uncovers spatiotemporal mechanisms that regulate lung BRM cell reactivation and demonstrates their capacity to rapidly deliver antibodies in a highly localized manner to sites of viral replication.

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main research objective**: 
- To understand how resident memory B cells (BRM) in the lungs respond to secondary influenza infection and contribute to immune protection

**Central question/problem**:
- How do lung-resident memory B cells contribute to recall responses during influenza reinfection?
- What are the mechanisms that regulate their activation and function?

**Context and relevance**:
- Despite available treatments, influenza continues to be a significant medical burden with pandemic potential
- Pre-existing antibodies can provide sterilizing immunity, but their localization to infection sites is crucial
- Understanding mechanisms that increase local antibody titers could improve vaccine strategies

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General approach**:
- Used two-photon microscopy to visualize BRM cells in live lung tissue
- Employed a reporter mouse model (BAT) to track lung BRM cells and plasma cells
- Conducted adoptive transfer experiments to study memory B cell responses
- Performed single-cell RNA sequencing for molecular analysis

**Specific tools and methods**:
- Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy
- BAT reporter mice (Blimp1mVenus AIDCre/+ Rosa26tdTomato)
- Flow cytometry and cell sorting
- RNA sequencing (bulk and single-cell)
- Spatial statistics analysis (Ripley's K)

**Analyzed data/samples**:
- Live lung tissue sections
- Lung-resident memory B cells
- Plasma cells
- Gene expression profiles
- Cell migration patterns
- Antibody concentrations

**Methodological innovations**:
- Development of a fate-mapping approach to track lung-resident memory B cells
- Novel application of spatial statistics to quantify cell clustering
- Integration of live imaging with molecular analysis

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary discoveries**:
1. Lung BRM Cell Behavior:
   - BRM cells are randomly distributed in lung tissue during rest
   - They show limited motility in normal conditions
   - Upon rechallenge, they rapidly increase migration within 24 hours
   - Cells accumulate specifically in infected areas

2. Plasma Cell Development:
   - BRM cells differentiate into plasma cells in infected sites
   - This occurs independently of germinal center formation
   - Process leads to localized antibody production
   - New plasma cells appear within alveoli during secondary infection

3. Molecular Mechanism:
   - Alveolar macrophages orchestrate BRM cell activation
   - Process involves CXCL9 and CXCL10 chemokine production
   - CXCR3 receptor mediates BRM cell accumulation
   - IFNÎ³ pathway is crucial for the response

4. Functional Outcome:
   - Rapid increase in local antibody concentrations
   - Highly targeted response to infection sites
   - Independent of circulating B cell recruitment
   - Enhanced protection through localized antibody delivery

**Unexpected results**:
- BRM cell migration increase was independent of antigen specificity
- Response could be triggered by RNA-containing particles without viral antigens
- Alveolar plasma cells were unique to secondary responses

**Practical implications**:
- Suggests new strategies for vaccine development
- Highlights importance of targeting lung-resident immune cells
- Indicates potential for improving local immunity
- Offers new approach for preventing viral spread

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
