# Structured Summary: IgG subclasses and allotypes

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions
*   **Original Abstract:** Of the five immunoglobulin isotypes, immunoglobulin G (IgG) is most abundant in human serum. The four subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, which are highly conserved, differ in their constant region, particularly in their hinges and upper CH2 domains. These regions are involved in binding to both IgG-Fc receptors (FcγR) and C1q. As a result, the different subclasses have different effector functions, both in terms of triggering FcγR-expressing cells, resulting in phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and activating complement. The Fc-regions also contain a binding epitope for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), responsible for the extended half-life, placental transport, and bidirectional transport of IgG to mucosal surfaces. However, FcRn is also expressed in myeloid cells, where it participates in both phagocytosis and antigen presentation together with classical FcγR and complement. How these properties, IgG-polymorphisms and post-translational modification of the antibodies in the form of glycosylation, affect IgG-function will be the focus of the current review.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural and functional diversity of human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The main objective is to detail how variations at the level of IgG subclasses, genetic polymorphisms (allotypes), and post-translational modifications (glycosylation) impact the antibody's effector functions. The central problem addressed is the complexity of IgG biology, where subtle molecular differences lead to significant functional consequences. The study is relevant for immunology, vaccinology, and the development of therapeutic antibodies, as understanding this variability is crucial for predicting immune responses and designing more effective antibody-based therapies.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
As a review article, the methodology consists of a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of the existing scientific literature. The authors collate and interpret data from structural biology, genetics, and immunology to systematically describe the four human IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4). The paper reviews the structural basis for their distinct functional properties, focusing on the hinge and Fc regions. It also summarizes the current knowledge on IgG allotypes (genetic variants) and the impact of N-linked glycosylation on Fc receptor binding and effector functions. The information is presented through detailed descriptions and summary tables and figures.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **The four human IgG subclasses (IgG1-4) have distinct structural features that dictate their unique functional properties.** These subclasses differ primarily in their hinge region and the upper CH2 domain of the Fc fragment. These differences profoundly affect their flexibility, ability to activate complement (via C1q binding), and their affinity for various Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on immune cells (Table 1).
*   **IgG1 and IgG3 are the primary pro-inflammatory and activating subclasses.** They bind strongly to most activating FcγRs and are potent activators of complement, making them effective at mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis. IgG3 is particularly effective but has a shorter half-life in some individuals.
*   **IgG2 and IgG4 have more specialized or immunomodulatory roles.** IgG2 is primarily elicited in response to polysaccharide antigens and is a poor activator of complement and FcγRs. IgG4 is often associated with repeated antigen exposure and has anti-inflammatory properties, partly due to its unique ability to undergo "Fab arm exchange," which renders it functionally monovalent and unable to cross-link antigens.
*   **Genetic polymorphisms (allotypes) and post-translational glycosylation add further layers of functional diversity.** Genetic variations within each subclass can affect properties like half-life and receptor binding. Furthermore, the composition of the N-linked glycan at position Asn297 in the Fc region is a critical modulator of effector function; for example, the absence of fucose dramatically increases the affinity for FcγRIIIa, enhancing ADCC.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The function of an IgG antibody is not solely determined by its antigen-binding specificity but is critically shaped by a complex interplay of its subclass, allotype, and glycosylation status. These three layers of variation fine-tune the antibody's ability to engage with the immune system's effector mechanisms. The review concludes that this inherent variability is a key feature of the humoral immune response, allowing it to be tailored to different types of pathogens and inflammatory contexts. Understanding this complexity is essential for the rational design of therapeutic antibodies and for interpreting the efficacy of vaccines.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **IgG Subclasses:** The four distinct types of IgG antibodies (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) in humans, each with a unique heavy chain constant region that confers different biological functions.
    *   **Effector Functions:** The actions that an antibody performs after binding to its antigen, such as activating complement, triggering phagocytosis, or inducing cell killing by NK cells (ADCC).
    *   **Fc Region (Fragment, crystallizable):** The "tail" region of an antibody that interacts with Fc receptors on immune cells and proteins of the complement system, thereby mediating effector functions.
    *   **Glycosylation:** The enzymatic process of attaching sugar chains (glycans) to proteins. The specific composition of the glycan attached to the IgG Fc region is a critical regulator of its function.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Allotype:** A genetically determined variant of a protein that differs between individuals of the same species. In antibodies, these are minor variations in the constant region sequence.
    *   **Fcγ Receptors (FcγR):** A family of receptors found on the surface of various immune cells (e.g., macrophages, NK cells) that bind to the Fc region of IgG antibodies and trigger cellular responses.
    *   **Fab Arm Exchange:** A unique process for IgG4 antibodies where they can swap half-molecules (one heavy and one light chain) with other IgG4 molecules, resulting in bispecific antibodies that can no longer cross-link antigens.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   The paper provides a highly structured and comprehensive synthesis of the multiple layers of IgG diversity, integrating structural, genetic, and functional data.
    *   It clearly explains how subtle changes in the IgG molecule—from a single amino acid polymorphism to the presence or absence of a single sugar residue—can have profound effects on its biological activity.
    *   It highlights the functional importance of often-overlooked aspects of antibody biology, such as hinge flexibility and Fab arm exchange, in determining the overall immune response.
