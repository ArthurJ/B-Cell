### Original Abstract
**Objectives**: This study aimed to provide real‐world data on the characteristics and treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) at the time of death.

**Methods**: The study was a retrospective patient chart review across France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK during 2016, and included patients who had died in the 3 months before the index date.

**Results**: Data from 786 patients were reviewed. At the time of death, 37% of patients were receiving active treatment, 12% were in a treatment‐free interval and 51% were receiving only supportive care. Death before and during active first‐line treatment was not uncommon (6% and 24% of patients, respectively) but these deaths were often not solely due to disease progression; factors such as renal failure and infection frequently played a role (in 30% and 20% of patients at first‐line, respectively). Most deaths at later lines were due to progressive disease. Cox model results suggested that early deaths were associated with advanced disease stage, high‐risk cytogenetics and poor response and relapse profiles.

**Conclusions**: These real‐world data could be used to help develop strategies for improving survival in patients with MM and to support management tailored to the stage of disease.

## 1. OVERVIEW
### Main Research Objective
To evaluate and understand mortality patterns and characteristics of patients with multiple myeloma at the time of death in a real-world setting.

### Central Question/Problem
What are the key factors and circumstances associated with mortality in multiple myeloma patients across different treatment stages?

### Context and Relevance
- Multiple myeloma affects approximately 4 in 100,000 individuals in Europe
- Despite improved survival rates over recent decades, response to treatment remains variable
- Understanding mortality patterns is crucial for developing better treatment strategies

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
### General Approach
- Retrospective chart review study
- Conducted across five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK)
- Data collection period: Second half of 2016

### Specific Tools and Methods
- Patient eligibility: Diagnosed with symptomatic MM and died within 3 months before index date
- Data collection from 391 physicians across 391 centers
- Cox model regression analysis for survival factors
- Weighted data analysis according to MM prevalence in each country

### Analyzed Data/Samples
- Total sample: 786 deceased patients
- Geographic distribution:
  - France: 139 patients
  - Germany: 171 patients
  - Italy: 171 patients
  - Spain: 138 patients
  - UK: 167 patients

## 3. KEY FINDINGS
### Primary Discoveries
1. Treatment Status at Death:
   - 37% receiving active treatment
   - 12% in treatment-free interval
   - 51% receiving only supportive care

2. Treatment Line Distribution:
   - 24% died during/after first-line treatment
   - Similar proportions at second and third lines
   - Fewer deaths at fourth and fifth lines

3. Cause of Death Patterns:
   - 67% primarily attributed to disease progression
   - Early treatment lines: Multiple factors including renal failure (30%) and infection (20%)
   - Later treatment lines: Predominantly disease progression

4. Patient Characteristics:
   - Earlier line deaths: Typically older patients, higher ISS stage
   - Later line deaths: Younger patients, lower ISS stage, better performance status

### Practical Implications
- Need for improved supportive care during active treatment
- Importance of managing complications in early treatment phases
- Necessity for tailored management approaches based on disease stage

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
### General Conclusions
- Deaths during early treatment lines remain a key challenge
- Mortality causes vary significantly by treatment stage
- Multiple factors beyond disease progression contribute to early mortality

### Practical Applications
- Development of better supportive care strategies
- Need for improved management of complications
- Importance of risk-adapted treatment approaches

### Study Limitations
- Potential data inconsistencies from site-specific management differences
- Variation in clinical interpretation of disease progression
- Analysis limited by inclusion of only deceased patients
- Characteristics at each treatment line from separate populations

## 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS
### Key Concepts
- Treatment-line mortality patterns
- Real-world mortality factors
- Disease progression patterns

### Important Technical Terms
- ISS (International Staging System)
- Treatment-free interval (TFI)
- Cytogenetic risk status
- Disease progression markers

### Innovative Insights
- Comprehensive real-world mortality data in European MM patients
- Multiple cause analysis of death across treatment lines
- Identification of early mortality risk factors

### Significant Contributions
- Largest European study focusing on deceased MM patients
- Real-world evidence for treatment strategy development
- Framework for improved patient management approaches
