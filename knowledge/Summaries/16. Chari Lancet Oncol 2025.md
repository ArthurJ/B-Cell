*   **Original Title:** Safety and activity of talquetamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MonumenTAL-1): a multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2 study
*   **Original Abstract:** **Background** Talquetamab is the first GPRC5D×CD3 bispecific antibody approved for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In phase 1 of the MonumenTAL-1 study, initial results of subcutaneous talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg once a week and 0.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks showed preliminary clinical activity. We describe safety and activity results in patients treated with talquetamab, including patients who had received previous T-cell redirection therapy (TCR). This post-hoc analysis was done with more mature median follow-up to evaluate duration of response in patients treated with talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. **Methods** MonumenTAL-1 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 1–2 study of talquetamab, phase 1 of which has previously been published. The 0.4 mg/kg once a week and 0.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks recommended subcutaneous doses identified in phase 1 were evaluated in phase 2 in patients who were 18 years of age or older, had at least three previous lines of therapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and were naive or exposed to previous TCR. The primary endpoint was overall response rate assessed by independent review committee in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399799 (phase 1) and NCT04634552 (phase 2). **Findings** Between Jan 3, 2018, and Feb 20, 2023, 735 patients were screened across all phase 1–2 cohorts. Of these, 537 patients screened for inclusion were treated across phase 1 and 2 cohorts, of whom 198 (27%) patients were excluded from the study, most commonly due to not meeting eligibility criteria or not having measurable disease. As of Oct 11, 2023, 375 patients had received recommended talquetamab doses across three groups: 143 (0·4 mg/kg once a week group) and 154 (0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group) TCR-naive patients and 78 with previous TCR who received either recommended dose (previous TCR group). 217 (58%) of 375 patients were male and 158 (42%) were female. 325 (87%) of 375 patients were White and 32 (9%) patients were Black. Median follow-up was 25·6 months (IQR 8·5–25·9) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 19·4 months (9·2–20·7) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 16·8 months (7·6–18·7) in the previous TCR group. Overall response rate was 74% (106 of 143 patients, 95% CI 66–81) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 69% (107 of 154 patients, 62–77) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 67% (52 of 78 patients, 55–77) in the previous TCR group. Most common adverse events in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week, 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and previous TCR groups were cytokine release syndrome (113 [79%] of 143 patients, 115 [75%] of 154 patients, and 57 [73%] of 78 patients), taste changes (103 [72%], 110 [71%], and 59 [76%]), and infections (85 [59%], 105 [68%], and 59 [76%]). Most common grade 3–4 adverse events were neutropenia (44 [31%], 33 [21%], and 37 [47%]), anaemia (45 [31%], 40 [26%], and 21 [27%]), and lymphopenia (37 [26%], 40 [26%], and 13 [17%]). Fatal adverse events occurred in five patients in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, seven patients in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and no patients in the previous TCR group; none were related to treatment. **Interpretation** Talquetamab continued to demonstrate high overall response rates in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with longer follow-up in this post-hoc analysis. Overall response rate was promising in patients with previous TCR, including therapies targeting BCMA. On-target, off-tumour adverse events were common but led to few treatment discontinuations.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This post-hoc analysis of the MonumenTAL-1 study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and activity of talquetamab in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The central question was whether the initial promising efficacy and manageable safety profile of this first-in-class GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody were durable over a more mature median follow-up. This research is clinically significant as it provides crucial long-term outcome data, including in patients who had already failed other T-cell redirection therapies, thereby helping to define talquetamab's role in the treatment landscape for this hard-to-treat patient population.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This study is a post-hoc analysis of the multicenter, open-label, phase 1-2 MonumenTAL-1 trial. It evaluated data from 375 patients with RRMM who received one of two recommended subcutaneous doses of talquetamab: 0.4 mg/kg once a week (QW) or 0.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). The analysis included cohorts of patients who were naive to T-cell redirection therapy (TCR) and a separate cohort of patients who had received prior TCR (e.g., CAR-T or other bispecific antibodies). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Talquetamab demonstrated high and durable overall response rates (ORR) with extended follow-up.** The ORR was 74% in the 0.4 mg/kg weekly (QW) group and 69% in the 0.8 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) group. Responses were durable, with the Q2W schedule showing a longer median duration of response (16.9 months vs. 9.5 months for the QW schedule).
*   **Significant clinical activity was observed in patients who had failed prior T-cell redirection therapies.** In the heavily pretreated cohort of patients with prior exposure to TCR therapies (mostly targeting BCMA), the ORR was 67%. Specifically, the ORR was 72% in patients who had received prior CAR-T therapy, demonstrating talquetamab's efficacy in a population with a high unmet need.
*   **The safety profile remained consistent and manageable, with few treatment discontinuations.** The most common adverse events (AEs) were cytokine release syndrome (73–79%), taste changes (71–76%), and infections (59–76%). These on-target, off-tumor AEs were predominantly low-grade and led to few discontinuations. Fatal AEs were rare and not attributed to the treatment.
*   **The infection rate was favorable compared to other immunotherapies.** The rate of grade 3-4 infections was 26% or lower across cohorts. The authors suggest this may be due to the GPRC5D target sparing B cells and normal plasma cells, thus preserving humoral immunity more effectively than BCMA-targeting agents.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
With longer-term follow-up, talquetamab continues to show deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Its efficacy is also promising in the growing population of patients who have relapsed after prior T-cell redirection therapies targeting BCMA. The unique safety profile, characterized by manageable on-target, off-tumor toxicities and a favorable infection rate, was consistent over time. These findings support talquetamab as a valuable therapeutic option. A limitation of the study is its post-hoc, single-arm design, which precludes direct comparisons to other treatments.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** A first-in-class bispecific antibody that redirects the patient's T cells to kill multiple myeloma cells by targeting the GPRC5D protein.
    *   **On-target, Off-tumor Toxicity:** Side effects caused by the drug acting on its intended target (GPRC5D) but on healthy tissues where the target is also expressed (e.g., skin, tongue, nail beds), leading to characteristic toxicities like taste changes and skin rashes.
    *   **T-cell Redirection Therapy (TCR):** A class of immunotherapy that includes bispecific antibodies and CAR-T cells, which function by engaging T cells to fight cancer.
    *   **Durable Response:** A clinical response to treatment that is maintained for a significant period.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D):** A protein highly expressed on malignant plasma cells but with limited expression on most normal cells, making it a specific target for myeloma therapy.
    *   **Overall Response Rate (ORR):** The percentage of patients in a clinical trial whose tumors shrink or disappear in response to treatment.
    *   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** A common systemic inflammatory response to T-cell engaging therapies, characterized by fever and other flu-like symptoms, which can be life-threatening if severe.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This analysis provides the most mature follow-up data for a GPRC5D-targeting therapy, confirming the long-term durability of responses and the manageable safety of talquetamab.
    *   It establishes the efficacy of talquetamab in patients who have already been treated with and relapsed after other T-cell redirection therapies, particularly those targeting BCMA, which is a critical finding for sequencing immunotherapies.
    *   The data reinforce the favorable infection profile of talquetamab, suggesting a potential safety advantage over other bispecific antibodies due to its B-cell sparing mechanism.
