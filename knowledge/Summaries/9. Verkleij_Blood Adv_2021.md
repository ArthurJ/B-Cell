**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Preclinical activity and determinants of response of the GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody talquetamab in multiple myeloma
*   **Original Abstract:** Cell surface expression levels of GPRC5D, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, are significantly higher on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, compared with normal plasma cells or other immune cells, which renders it a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies. The novel GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody, talquetamab, effectively kills GPRC5D+ MM cell lines in the presence of T cells from both healthy donors or heavily pretreated MM patients. In addition, talquetamab has potent anti-MM activity in bone marrow (BM) samples from 45 patients, including those with high-risk cytogenetic aberrations. There was no difference in talquetamab-mediated killing of MM cells from newly diagnosed, daratumumab-na√Øve relapsed/refractory (median of 3 prior therapies), and daratumumab-refractory (median of 6 prior therapies) MM patients. Tumor cell lysis was accompanied by T-cell activation and degranulation, as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. High levels of GPRC5D and high effector:target ratio were associated with improved talquetamab-mediated lysis of MM cells, whereas an increased proportion of T cells expressing PD-1 or HLA-DR, and elevated regulatory T-cell (Treg) counts were associated with suboptimal killing. In cell line experiments, addition of Tregs to effector cells decreased MM cell lysis. Direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells also impaired the efficacy of talquetamab. Combination therapy with daratumumab or pomalidomide enhanced talquetamab-mediated lysis of primary MM cells in an additive fashion. In conclusion, we show that the GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody talquetamab is a promising novel antimyeloma agent. These results provide the preclinical rationale for ongoing studies with talquetamab in relapsed/refractory MM.

### 1. OVERVIEW
The study's primary objective is to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of talquetamab, a novel GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody, for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). It addresses the urgent need for new therapies for MM patients, particularly those refractory to existing treatments, by validating GPRC5D as a specific target. This research provides a robust preclinical rationale for ongoing clinical trials by demonstrating talquetamab's potent anti-myeloma activity and identifying key tumor and immune characteristics, such as GPRC5D expression levels and regulatory T-cell counts, that influence the therapeutic response.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This preclinical study utilized *in vitro* and extensive *ex vivo* methods to assess the activity of talquetamab. Cell surface GPRC5D protein expression was quantified using flow cytometry on fresh bone marrow samples from 74 multiple myeloma (MM) patients at various disease stages and 11 healthy donors. The antibody's efficacy was tested using cytotoxicity assays on MM cell lines and primary patient MM cells co-cultured with autologous T cells. T-cell activation, degranulation, and cytokine release were measured to confirm the mechanism of action. The study also employed co-culture systems to investigate the impact of the tumor microenvironment, specifically bone marrow stromal cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), on talquetamab's activity.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **GPRC5D is highly and selectively expressed on MM cells.** GPRC5D protein expression was significantly higher on MM cells compared to normal plasma cells and other hematopoietic cells (B cells, T cells, NK cells), confirming it as a specific target for immunotherapy (Figure 1A-B).
*   **Talquetamab potently kills primary MM cells from heavily pretreated patients.** Talquetamab induced effective, dose-dependent lysis of MM cells in bone marrow samples from 45 patients. Importantly, its activity was not diminished in patients who were refractory to standard therapies, including daratumumab (Figure 4C).
*   **The response to talquetamab is influenced by tumor and immune characteristics.** Higher GPRC5D expression on tumor cells and a higher effector-to-target (T-cell to MM cell) ratio were associated with more effective killing. Conversely, a high frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or exhausted (PD-1+) T cells in the bone marrow impaired talquetamab's efficacy (Figure 5).
*   **The tumor microenvironment can inhibit talquetamab activity.** Direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) significantly reduced talquetamab-mediated lysis of MM cells, partly by downregulating GPRC5D expression on the tumor cells (Figure 3). Furthermore, isolated Tregs were shown to suppress the killing capacity of effector T cells (Figure 6).
*   **Combination with standard MM drugs enhances talquetamab's efficacy.** The addition of either daratumumab (an anti-CD38 antibody) or pomalidomide (an immunomodulatory drug) to talquetamab resulted in an additive enhancement of MM cell killing in primary patient samples (Figure 7).

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
Talquetamab is a promising novel T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody for treating multiple myeloma, targeting the highly specific GPRC5D receptor. This study demonstrates that talquetamab potently kills myeloma cells from both newly diagnosed and heavily pretreated patients. However, its efficacy is modulated by factors within the tumor microenvironment, such as GPRC5D expression levels, effector-to-target ratio, and the presence of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. These preclinical findings provide a strong rationale for ongoing clinical trials of talquetamab and suggest that combination therapies could further enhance its therapeutic potential.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **GPRC5D as a Therapeutic Target:** The validation of this receptor as a highly specific marker for multiple myeloma cells, with minimal expression on normal tissues.
    *   **Bispecific T-cell Redirecting Antibody:** The mechanism of action of talquetamab, which physically links a patient's own T cells to tumor cells to induce targeted killing.
    *   **Determinants of Response:** The concept that treatment efficacy depends not only on the drug but also on the patient's specific tumor biology (e.g., target expression) and immune status (e.g., T-cell fitness).
    *   **Tumor Microenvironment Resistance:** The ability of non-cancerous cells in the tumor's vicinity, like stromal cells and regulatory T cells, to protect cancer cells from immunotherapy.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** An engineered antibody with two binding sites: one for the GPRC5D protein on myeloma cells and one for the CD3 protein on T cells, which forces the T cell to kill the myeloma cell.
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member D):** A protein found on the cell surface, which this study shows is present at high levels on multiple myeloma cells but very low levels on most normal cells.
    *   **Effector:Target (E:T) ratio:** The ratio of immune "effector" cells (T cells) to "target" tumor cells. A higher ratio generally leads to more effective tumor killing.
    *   **Regulatory T cells (Tregs):** A specialized subset of T cells that suppress immune responses. High numbers of Tregs in a tumor can prevent other immune cells from killing the cancer.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   Provides extensive preclinical validation for talquetamab, a first-in-class GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody, using a large cohort of primary patient samples across different stages of MM.
    *   Systematically identifies key patient-specific factors that predict response to talquetamab, including GPRC5D expression, E:T ratio, and the immunosuppressive presence of Tregs.
    *   Demonstrates that talquetamab's activity can be hampered by direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells, highlighting a mechanism of microenvironment-mediated resistance to T-cell engagers.
