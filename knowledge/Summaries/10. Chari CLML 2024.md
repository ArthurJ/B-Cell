# Structured Summary: Clinical Management of Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Treated With Talquetamab

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Clinical Management of Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Treated With Talquetamab
*   **Original Abstract:** Talquetamab had a unique pattern of T-cell- and GPRC5D-associated AEs in MonumenTAL-1. Dermatologic toxicities were managed with corticosteroids and emollients, oral AEs with dose modification, and infections per standard of care. Cytokine release syndrome/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome were managed consistent with other T-cell redirection therapies. GPRC5D-associated adverse events may improve or resolve over time. Overall, the safety profile was manageable with minimal discontinuations due to AEs. Background: Talquetamab is a bispecific antibody targeting the multiple myeloma-associated antigen G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D). In the phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 trial (NCT03399799/NCT04634552), overall responses rates were > 71% in patients with triple-class exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Due to the distribution of the target antigen, a unique pattern of GPRC5D-associated adverse events (AEs) was observed, together with T-cell redirection-associated AEs. Management strategies for talquetamab-associated AEs are described. Discussion: GPRC5D-associated AEs included dermatologic (rash, nonrash, and nail toxicities) and oral AEs (dysgeusia, dysphagia, and dry mouth). The incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were consistent with other T-cell redirection therapies. The incidence of high-grade infections was lower than observed with B-cell maturation antigen-targeting bispecific antibodies, with less frequent use of intravenous immunoglobulin required. GPRC5D-associated AEs were mostly low grade and led to few discontinuations. Skin toxicities were managed with emollients, topical corticosteroids, and oral corticosteroids (for high-grade, persistent, or AEs that progress). Nail toxicities were commonly managed with emollients. Based on investigator experience, dose modification may be effective for controlling oral events. Observation for potential weight changes is required. Infections were managed per standard of care. CRS and ICANS were effectively managed, consistent with other trials of T-cell redirection therapies. Conclusion: Although talquetamab had a distinct safety profile, AEs were considered clinically manageable and mostly low grade. With appropriate education and support, health care practitioners can ensure patients with RRMM maintain quality of life and treatment adherence.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This perspective article provides clinical guidance for managing the adverse events (AEs) associated with talquetamab, a bispecific antibody for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The central problem is the unique safety profile of talquetamab, which includes both class-specific T-cell redirection effects and novel toxicities related to its GPRC5D target. The study is clinically significant as it synthesizes data and expert experience from the MonumenTAL-1 trial to offer practical strategies for clinicians, aiming to improve patient safety, quality of life, and treatment adherence for this newly approved and highly effective therapy.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
The paper is a perspective article that synthesizes and interprets safety data from the pivotal Phase 1/2 MonumenTAL-1 clinical trial. The authors reviewed adverse event data from 339 patients with RRMM treated with talquetamab, focusing on the incidence, grading, timing, and resolution of toxicities. This quantitative analysis is combined with clinical experience from trial investigators to formulate expert recommendations for the monitoring, prevention, and management of talquetamab-associated AEs. The methodology does not involve new primary research but rather provides a structured clinical framework based on existing trial evidence.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Talquetamab is associated with a unique set of GPRC5D-related toxicities.** Due to GPRC5D expression in keratinized tissues, patients commonly experience dermatologic AEs (rash, dry skin, pruritus), nail toxicities (discoloration, dystrophy), and oral AEs. Oral toxicities, particularly dysgeusia (altered taste), were very frequent (~72%), mostly low-grade, and often required management through dose modifications and supportive care.
*   **T-cell redirection toxicities are frequent but manageable.** Consistent with its mechanism of action, talquetamab caused Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in approximately 77% of patients and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) in about 10%. These events were predominantly low-grade (Grade 1-2), occurred early during step-up dosing, and were effectively managed with standard protocols, including the use of tocilizumab.
*   **The infection profile of talquetamab appears favorable compared to other immunotherapies.** The incidence of high-grade (Grade 3/4) infections was lower than that reported for B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting bispecific antibodies. This is attributed to the lack of GPRC5D expression on normal B cells and plasma cells, which spares humoral immunity and reduces the need for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
*   **Adverse events were manageable and led to few treatment discontinuations.** Despite the unique safety profile, most AEs were low-grade and could be managed with supportive measures (e.g., emollients, corticosteroids), dose modifications (delays, reductions), and patient education. As a result, discontinuation of talquetamab due to AEs was minimal, allowing patients to continue benefiting from the therapy.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
Talquetamab presents a distinct but clinically manageable safety profile that requires specific management strategies. The GPRC5D-related oral and dermatologic toxicities, though common, are mostly low-grade and can be controlled with supportive care and dose adjustments. T-cell redirection AEs are manageable with established protocols. Its favorable infection profile makes it a valuable option for patients with RRMM. The practical guidance provided in this article is crucial for clinicians to effectively manage these toxicities, thereby maintaining patient quality of life and ensuring adherence to this effective therapy.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** A T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody that targets GPRC5D on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells to induce cancer cell killing.
    *   **GPRC5D-Associated Adverse Events:** A novel class of side effects specific to targeting the GPRC5D protein, including skin, nail, and oral toxicities (e.g., dysgeusia).
    *   **On-target, Off-tumor Toxicity:** Adverse effects caused by the drug binding to its intended target (GPRC5D) on healthy, non-cancerous tissues where the target is also expressed.
    *   **Adverse Event Management:** The primary focus of the paper, detailing practical clinical strategies for monitoring, mitigating, and treating the side effects of talquetamab.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D):** A protein highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells but also present in healthy tissues like hair follicles, nail beds, and filiform papillae of the tongue.
    *   **Dysgeusia:** A distortion of the sense of taste, reported as a very common and characteristic side effect of talquetamab therapy.
    *   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** A systemic inflammatory response triggered by T-cell activating immunotherapies, commonly characterized by fever, hypotension, and hypoxia.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This article serves as one of the first comprehensive clinical guides for managing the unique side effect profile of talquetamab.
    *   It clearly delineates GPRC5D-related toxicities from general T-cell engager toxicities, providing tailored management strategies for each class of AE.
    *   It highlights the comparatively lower risk of severe infections with talquetamab versus BCMA-targeting agents, establishing a key safety advantage and differentiator for clinical practice.
