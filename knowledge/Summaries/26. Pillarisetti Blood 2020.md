# Structured Summary: A T-cell-redirecting bispecific G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D x CD3 antibody to treat multiple myeloma

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** A T-cell-redirecting bispecific G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D x CD3 antibody to treat multiple myeloma
*   **Original Abstract:** T-cell-mediated approaches have shown promise in myeloma treatment. However, there are currently a limited number of specific myeloma antigens that can be targeted, and multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D) is expressed in MM and smoldering MM patient plasma cells. Here, we demonstrate that GPRC5D protein is present on the surface of MM cells and describe JNJ-64407564, a GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody that recruits CD3+ T cells to GPRC5D+ MM cells and induces killing of GPRC5D+ cells. In vitro, JNJ-64407564 induced specific cytotoxicity of GPRC5D+ cells with concomitant T-cell activation and also killed plasma cells in MM patient samples ex vivo. JNJ-64407564 can recruit T cells and induce tumor regression in GPRC5D+ MM murine models, which coincide with T-cell infiltration at the tumor site. This antibody is also able to induce cytotoxicity of patient primary MM cells from bone marrow, which is the natural site of this disease. GPRC5D is a promising surface antigen for MM immunotherapy, and JNJ-64407564 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory MM (NCT03399799).

### 1. OVERVIEW
This study aimed to validate G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D) as a new therapeutic target for multiple myeloma (MM). The central question was whether a novel bispecific antibody, JNJ-64407564, targeting both GPRC5D on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells, could effectively induce T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. Given that MM remains incurable and requires new therapeutic options, this research provides a critical preclinical proof-of-concept for a first-in-class immunotherapy, establishing a strong rationale for its ongoing clinical development in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
The study utilized a multi-faceted preclinical approach to evaluate the GPRC5D target and the efficacy of the bispecific antibody JNJ-64407564. The general approach included *in vitro*, *ex vivo*, and *in vivo* models. GPRC5D expression was first confirmed at the mRNA level using public patient datasets and at the protein level on MM cell lines and primary patient bone marrow samples via flow cytometry. The antibody's specificity was validated using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cell lines. T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and activation were assessed in co-culture assays with MM cell lines and patient-derived plasma cells. Finally, *in vivo* anti-tumor activity was evaluated in human MM xenograft mouse models engrafted with human immune cells (PBMCs).

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **GPRC5D is selectively expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells.** Bioinformatic analysis showed higher GPRC5D mRNA in MM patient cells compared to normal cells (Figure 1A-B). Flow cytometry confirmed that GPRC5D protein is present on the surface of various MM cell lines and primary patient plasma cells, but shows minimal to no expression on other hematopoietic cells or in most healthy tissues (Figure 1C, 1F).
*   **The bispecific antibody JNJ-64407564 induces potent and specific T-cell-mediated killing of GPRC5D-positive cells.** In *in vitro* co-cultures, JNJ-64407564 led to dose-dependent lysis of GPRC5D+ MM cells but not GPRC5D- cells (Figure 2A). This killing was accompanied by T-cell activation and cytokine release. Specificity was further confirmed using CRISPR-generated GPRC5D knockout cells, which were resistant to killing (Figure 3D).
*   **GPRC5D and BCMA are expressed heterogeneously and independently in MM patients.** Analysis of 51 primary MM patient samples revealed that while most co-expressed both antigens, a subset of patients showed high expression of one target but low expression of the other (Figure 3B). This suggests GPRC5D is a valuable target that is not necessarily co-regulated with BCMA.
*   **JNJ-64407564 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity in mouse models.** In a prophylactic H929 xenograft model, the antibody prevented tumor formation. In an established MM.1S tumor model, JNJ-64407564 treatment led to profound, dose-dependent tumor regression, with complete responses observed at higher doses (Figure 6B). This therapeutic effect was associated with increased T-cell infiltration into the tumors.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The study concludes that GPRC5D is a promising, selectively expressed surface antigen for multiple myeloma immunotherapy. The novel GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody, JNJ-64407564, effectively redirects T cells to kill GPRC5D-expressing myeloma cells, demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity in a range of preclinical models. These results provide a strong biological rationale for the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of JNJ-64407564 in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. The independent expression of GPRC5D from BCMA suggests its potential utility in patients who may not respond to or have relapsed after BCMA-targeted therapies.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **GPRC5D (G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D):** A novel cell-surface protein identified as a highly specific therapeutic target on multiple myeloma cells.
    *   **T-cell Redirecting Bispecific Antibody:** An engineered antibody that acts as a bridge, connecting a T cell to a cancer cell to force an immune attack.
    *   **Target Heterogeneity:** The observation that different tumor antigens (like GPRC5D and BCMA) are expressed at varying and independent levels across different patients' tumors, which has implications for sequencing therapies.
    *   **Preclinical Proof-of-Concept:** Demonstration of a drug's mechanism of action and efficacy in laboratory models (*in vitro*, *ex vivo*, and *in vivo*) to justify its testing in human clinical trials.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Bispecific Antibody (JNJ-64407564):** An artificial antibody construct designed to bind to two different targets simultaneously; in this case, GPRC5D on myeloma cells and the CD3 protein on T cells.
    *   **Xenograft Model:** An animal model where human tumor cells are implanted into immunodeficient mice to study tumor growth and test the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.
    *   **Multiple Myeloma (MM):** A cancer of plasma cells, which are antibody-producing white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This is the first comprehensive preclinical study to validate a GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody, providing the foundational evidence for its clinical development.
    *   It establishes GPRC5D as a viable and independent therapeutic target from BCMA, suggesting a potential new treatment avenue for patients who fail BCMA-targeted therapies.
    *   The research successfully demonstrates the "bench-to-bedside" rationale for JNJ-64407564, linking target identification to the development and potent activity of a novel therapeutic agent.
