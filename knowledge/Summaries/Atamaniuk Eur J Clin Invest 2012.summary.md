**Original Abstract**:
Background: G protein-coupled receptor 5D (GPRC5D) is a novel surface receptor. As this new subtype of G protein-coupled receptors was discovered, little is known about the role of this gene.

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, we investigated GPRC5D mRNA expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) of 48 patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

Results: Highly variable levels of GPRC5D (median, 288; quartiles, 17–928) were detected in patients with MM, whereas only low expression was detected in normal tissues (median, 1; quartiles, 1–23). High mRNA expression of GPRC5D correlated positively with high plasma cell count in bone marrow (r = 0.64, P < 0.001), high β2-microglobulin (r = 0.42, P = 0.003) and poor-risk cytogenetics: deletion 13q14 (rb-1), P = 0.003; and 14q32 translocation t(4;14)(p16;q32), P = 0.029. GPRC5D mRNA expression showed a significant correlation with overall survival (P = 0.031). The estimated overall survival of patients expressing GPRC5D above or below the median of 288 was 43.9% vs. 70.2% at 48 months. Here, we report, for the first time, the association of GPRC5D expression and cancer.

Conclusions: Overexpression in poor-risk myeloma, low expression in normal tissues and cell surface expression identify GPRC5D as a potential novel cancer antigen. Our data demonstrate that GPRC5D is a prognostic factor in MM correlating with other major risk factors.

## 1. OVERVIEW
### Main Research Objective
To investigate the role of GPRC5D mRNA expression in multiple myeloma and its potential as a prognostic marker.

### Central Question/Problem
- What is the clinical significance of GPRC5D expression in multiple myeloma patients?
- Can GPRC5D serve as a prognostic marker in MM?

### Context and Relevance
- First report of GPRC5D's association with cancer
- Multiple myeloma remains largely incurable, creating a need for new therapeutic targets and prognostic markers
- Understanding GPRC5D's role could lead to new therapeutic strategies

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
### General Approach
- Retrospective study design
- Analysis of bone marrow samples from 48 MM patients
- Comparison with normal tissue samples and cell lines

### Specific Tools and Methods
- Real-time PCR for GPRC5D mRNA expression analysis
- Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for genetic aberrations
- Statistical analysis using univariate and multi-variable Cox models
- Kaplan-Meier survival analysis

### Analyzed Data/Samples
- 48 MM patient bone marrow samples
- Control samples from:
  * 10 healthy bone marrow donors
  * 10 peripheral blood samples
  * Various tissue samples and cell lines

## 3. KEY FINDINGS
### Primary Discoveries
1. GPRC5D Expression Levels:
   - Highly variable in MM patients (median 288, quartiles 17-928)
   - Low in normal tissues (median 1, quartiles 1-23)

2. Clinical Correlations:
   - Strong positive correlation with:
     * Plasma cell count (r = 0.64, P < 0.001)
     * β2-microglobulin levels (r = 0.42, P = 0.003)
     * Poor-risk cytogenetics
   - Significant impact on overall survival

3. Survival Impact:
   - 48-month overall survival:
     * High GPRC5D expression: 43.9%
     * Low GPRC5D expression: 70.2%

4. Tissue Specificity:
   - Highest expression in testis (142-fold)
   - Limited expression in normal tissues
   - No expression in various cell lines tested

### Practical Implications
- Potential use as a prognostic marker in MM
- Possible therapeutic target due to:
  * Surface expression
  * Limited expression in normal tissues
  * Presence of potential T-helper and CTL epitopes

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
