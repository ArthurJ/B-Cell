**Original Abstract**:
Cell surface expression levels of GPRC5D, an orphan G protein–coupled receptor, are significantly higher on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, compared with normal plasma cells or other immune cells, which renders it a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies. The novel GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody, talquetamab, effectively kills GPRC5D+ MM cell lines in the presence of T cells from both healthy donors or heavily pretreated MM patients. In addition, talquetamab has potent anti-MM activity in bone marrow (BM) samples from 45 patients, including those with high-risk cytogenetic aberrations. There was no difference in talquetamab-mediated killing of MM cells from newly diagnosed, daratumumab-naïve relapsed/refractory (median of 3 prior therapies), and daratumumab-refractory (median of 6 prior therapies) MM patients. Tumor cell lysis was accompanied by T-cell activation and degranulation, as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. High levels of GPRC5D and high effector:target ratio were associated with improved talquetamab-mediated lysis of MM cells, whereas an increased proportion of T cells expressing PD-1 or HLA-DR, and elevated regulatory T-cell (Treg) counts were associated with suboptimal killing. In cell line experiments, addition of Tregs to effector cells decreased MM cell lysis. Direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells also impaired the efficacy of talquetamab. Combination therapy with daratumumab or pomalidomide enhanced talquetamab-mediated lysis of primary MM cells in an additive fashion. In conclusion, we show that the GPRC5D-targeting T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody talquetamab is a promising novel antimyeloma agent. These results provide the preclinical rationale for ongoing studies with talquetamab in relapsed/refractory MM.

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Main Research Objective
To evaluate the preclinical activity and response determinants of talquetamab, a novel GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody, in multiple myeloma.

### Central Question/Problem
- How effective is talquetamab against multiple myeloma cells?
- What factors influence its therapeutic efficacy?
- Can it be effective in patients who have become resistant to other treatments?

### Context and Relevance
- Multiple myeloma patients who become refractory to standard therapies have poor outcomes
- New therapeutic targets are needed, especially for triple-class refractory patients
- GPRC5D represents a novel target with selective expression on MM cells

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

### General Approach
- Comprehensive preclinical evaluation using both cell lines and patient samples
- Analysis of GPRC5D expression in various patient groups
- Assessment of talquetamab's activity in different experimental conditions

### Specific Tools and Methods
- Flow cytometry for protein expression analysis
- Bioluminescence imaging-based cytotoxicity assays
- Gene expression profiling
- Cell culture experiments with various conditions

### Analyzed Data/Samples
- MM cell lines (U266, RPMI-8226, MM.1S, UM9)
- 74 MM patient bone marrow samples for GPRC5D expression analysis
- 45 patient samples for ex vivo efficacy studies
- Samples from different patient groups:
  * Newly diagnosed MM
  * Daratumumab-naïve relapsed/refractory MM
  * Daratumumab-refractory MM

### Methodological Innovations
- Novel approach to studying T-cell redirecting therapy in MM
- Comprehensive analysis of microenvironmental factors
- Integration of multiple experimental approaches to understand response determinants

   - No significant difference between newly diagnosed and refractory patients

2. Talquetamab Efficacy:
   - Effective killing of GPRC5D+ MM cell lines
   - Potent activity in patient bone marrow samples
   - Similar efficacy across different patient groups regardless of prior treatment

3. Response Determinants:
   - Positive factors:
     * High GPRC5D expression
     * High effector:target ratio
   - Negative factors:
     * Elevated Treg counts
     * High proportion of PD-1+ or HLA-DR+ T cells
     * Direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells

4. Combination Therapy:
   - Enhanced efficacy when combined with daratumumab or pomalidomide
   - Additive effects observed in primary MM cells

### Practical Implications
- Potential new treatment option for relapsed/refractory MM patients
- Importance of considering immune microenvironment in treatment strategies
- Rationale for combination therapy approaches
- Potential for patient stratification based on GPRC5D expression
