**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Comparative Efficacy of Talquetamab vs. Current Treatments in the LocoMMotion and MoMMent Studies in Patients with Triple-Class-Exposed Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
*   **Original Abstract:** **Introduction:** Talquetamab, a bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D × CD3, is approved for the treatment of patients with triple-class exposed (TCE) relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) on the basis of the results from the phase I/II MonumenTAL-1 trial. The relative effectiveness of talquetamab vs. real-world physician's choice of therapy (RWPC) was assessed using adjusted comparisons. **Methods:** An external control arm for MonumenTAL-1 (subcutaneously administered talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly [QW] and 0.8 mg/kg every other week [Q2W]) was created from two observational real-world studies: LocoMMotion and MoMMent. Imbalances in baseline covariates were adjusted using inverse probability weighting. The relative effectiveness of talquetamab vs. RWPC was estimated for overall response rate (ORR), ≥ very good partial response (VGPR), and ≥ complete response (CR); odds ratios and relative response ratios (RRs) were derived from weighted logistic regression. Hazard ratios (HRs) for duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. **Results:** After reweighting, baseline characteristics were balanced across cohorts. In adjusted comparisons, patients treated with talquetamab QW (n = 143) had significantly improved outcomes vs. RWPC; RRs were ORR 2.67, *p* < 0.0001; ≥ VGPR 4.70, *p* < 0.0001; ≥ CR 78.05, *p* = 0.0002; and HRs were PFS 0.52, *p* < 0.0001; TTNT 0.48, *p* < 0.0001; OS 0.36, *p* < 0.0001. Patients treated with talquetamab Q2W (n = 145) also had significantly improved outcomes vs. RWPC; RRs were ORR 2.62, *p* < 0.0001; ≥ VGPR 5.04, *p* < 0.0001; ≥ CR 101.14, *p* = 0.0002; and HRs were PFS 0.40, *p* < 0.0001; TTNT 0.39, *p* < 0.0001; OS 0.37, *p* < 0.0001. **Conclusion:** Effectiveness of talquetamab for both schedules was significantly better than RWPC for ORR, ≥ VGPR, ≥ CR, PFS, OS, and TTNT, highlighting its clinical benefit for patients with TCE RRMM.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This study aims to compare the efficacy of talquetamab against real-world physician's choice (RWPC) therapies for triple-class-exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (TCE RRMM). The central question is whether talquetamab offers a significant clinical benefit over currently available treatments, as the pivotal MonumenTAL-1 trial lacked a direct comparator arm. This adjusted comparison is crucial for contextualizing talquetamab's effectiveness in a heavily pretreated patient population with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, providing evidence for its use in clinical practice.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This study performed an adjusted comparison using an external control arm. Individual patient data from the single-arm Phase I/II MonumenTAL-1 trial (talquetamab treatment) were compared against a real-world physician's choice (RWPC) cohort derived from the prospective, observational LocoMMotion and MoMMent studies. To account for baseline differences between the cohorts, a statistical technique called Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) was used to balance prognostic factors. The relative effectiveness of talquetamab was then estimated for key efficacy endpoints, including response rates (ORR, VGPR, CR) and time-to-event outcomes (PFS, OS, TTNT), using weighted regression models.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **After statistical adjustment, talquetamab treatment resulted in significantly higher and deeper responses compared to real-world physician's choice (RWPC).** For the weekly (QW) dose, the relative response ratio (RR) for achieving an overall response was 2.67, for ≥VGPR it was 4.70, and for ≥CR it was 78.05 (all *p* < 0.001).
*   **Talquetamab significantly improved survival outcomes.** The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.52 (a 48% risk reduction) and for overall survival (OS) was 0.36 (a 64% risk reduction) for the QW dose compared to RWPC (both *p* < 0.0001).
*   **Both the weekly (QW) and every-other-week (Q2W) talquetamab dosing schedules demonstrated superior efficacy over RWPC across all major endpoints.** This included overall response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, and time to next treatment (TTNT).
*   **The use of Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) successfully balanced key baseline prognostic factors between the talquetamab and RWPC cohorts.** This methodological step strengthened the validity of the comparative efficacy findings by creating comparable patient groups for analysis.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
Talquetamab, administered either weekly or every other week, is significantly more effective than current real-world physician's choice therapies for patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. It provides higher and deeper response rates and substantially improves survival outcomes. These results highlight the substantial clinical benefit of talquetamab and establish it as a highly effective therapy for this patient population with limited options. While statistical adjustments were made, the study's non-randomized nature means the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors cannot be entirely excluded.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Adjusted Indirect Comparison:** A method for comparing treatments from different studies (one of which is typically a single-arm trial) by statistically balancing the baseline characteristics of the patient populations to create a fair comparison.
    *   **External Control Arm:** A group of patients from an external data source (in this case, observational studies) used as a comparator for an interventional trial that does not have its own randomized control group.
    *   **Triple-Class-Exposed (TCE) RRMM:** A difficult-to-treat stage of multiple myeloma where patients have received and become resistant to at least one drug from each of the three main classes of therapy: proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Talquetamab:** A bispecific antibody that redirects T-cells to kill multiple myeloma cells by simultaneously binding to the GPRC5D protein on myeloma cells and the CD3 protein on T-cells.
    *   **Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW):** A statistical method that weights individuals in an observational study to create a "pseudo-population" in which the distribution of measured baseline covariates is independent of treatment exposure, thus mimicking a randomized controlled trial.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This study provides the first robust, adjusted comparative evidence demonstrating the clinical superiority of talquetamab over a wide range of real-world therapies used in current practice.
    *   It quantifies the substantial magnitude of benefit conferred by talquetamab, showing patients are several times more likely to achieve deep responses and have a >60% reduction in the risk of death compared to RWPC.
