### Original Abstract
B cells are critical mediators of humoral immune responses in the airways through antibody production, antigen presentation, and cytokine secretion. In addition, a subset of B cells, known as regulatory B cells (Bregs), exhibit immunosuppressive functions via diverse regulatory mechanisms. Bregs modulate immune responses via the secretion of IL-10, IL-35, and tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β), and by direct cell contact. The balance between effector and regulatory B cell functions is critical in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. The importance of Bregs in airway immune responses is emphasized by the different respiratory disorders associated with abnormalities in Breg numbers and function. In this review, we summarize the role of immunosuppressive Bregs in airway inflammatory diseases and highlight the importance of this subset in the maintenance of respiratory health. We propose that improved understanding of signals in the lung microenvironment that drive Breg differentiation can provide novel therapeutic avenues for improved management of respiratory diseases.
