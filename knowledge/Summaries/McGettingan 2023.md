**Abstract**: IL-10+ B cells are critical for immune homeostasis and restraining immune responses in infection, cancer, and inflammation; however, the signals that govern IL-10+ B cell differentiation are ill-defined. Here we find that IL-10+ B cells expand in mice lacking secreted IgM ((s)IgM–/–) up to 10-fold relative to wildtype (WT) among all major B cell and regulatory B cell subsets. The IL-10+ B cell increase is polyclonal and presents within 24 hours of birth. In WT mice, sIgM is produced prenatally and limits the expansion of IL-10+ B cells. Lack of the high affinity receptor for sIgM, FcμR, in B cells translates into an intermediate IL-10+ B cell phenotype relative to WT or sIgM–/– mice. Our study thus shows that sIgM regulates IL-10 programming in B cells in part via B cell-expressed FcμR, thereby revealing a function of sIgM in regulating immune homeostasis.

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main Research Objective**: 
To investigate the relationship between secreted IgM (sIgM) and IL-10 expression in B cells and understand its role in immune regulation.

**Central Question/Problem**:
How does secreted IgM influence IL-10+ B cell development and what mechanisms are involved in this regulation?

**Context and Relevance**:
- IL-10-producing B cells are crucial for immune homeostasis and controlling immune responses
- The signals governing IL-10+ B cell differentiation were previously poorly understood
- Understanding these mechanisms could provide new therapeutic targets for diseases involving immune dysregulation

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General Approach**:
- Comparative analysis between wild-type and sIgM-deficient mice
- Flow cytometry analysis of IL-10 expression in B cells
- Single-cell RNA sequencing for clonal diversity analysis
- Adoptive transfer experiments
- Analysis of various developmental stages and B cell subsets

**Specific Tools and Methods**:
- Flow cytometry for IL-10 and B cell marker analysis
- IL-10GFP reporter mice
- Single-cell VDJ repertoire analysis
- ELISA for serum IgM quantification
- qPCR for gene expression analysis

**Analyzed Samples**:
- Spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow cells from mice
- Various B cell subsets including follicular, marginal zone, and B-1 cells
- Newborn to adult mice at different developmental stages

**Methodological Innovations**:
- Combined analysis of IL-10 expression with B cell receptor repertoire at single-cell level
- Novel approach to studying prenatal and early postnatal regulation of IL-10+ B cells

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary Discoveries**:
1. sIgM-deficient mice show up to 10-fold increase in IL-10+ B cells compared to wild-type mice
2. The expansion of IL-10+ B cells occurs across all major B cell subsets
3. IL-10+ B cell increase is polyclonal and appears within 24 hours of birth
4. sIgM is produced prenatally and actively limits IL-10+ B cell expansion
5. FcμR receptor mediates part of sIgM's regulatory effect on IL-10 expression

**Practical Implications**:
- Reveals a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for IL-10+ B cells
- Suggests potential therapeutic approaches through modulating sIgM levels
- Provides insights into early-life immune regulation
- Identifies new targets for treating diseases involving immune dysregulation

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

**General Conclusions**:
- sIgM acts as a universal regulator of IL-10 programming in B cells
- The regulatory effect of sIgM on IL-10 expression is partly mediated through FcμR
- This mechanism is active from early development through adulthood

**Study Limitations**:
- Limited to mouse models
- Some technical challenges in heavy chain analysis
- Potential involvement of other sIgM receptors not fully explored

**Practical Applications**:
- Potential therapeutic targeting of sIgM-FcμR pathway in immune disorders
- New approaches for modulating IL-10+ B cell responses
- Insights for treating inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases
