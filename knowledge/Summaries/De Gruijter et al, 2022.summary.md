**Original Abstract**: 
B cells are classically considered solely as antibody-producing cells driving humoral immune responses to foreign antigens in infections and vaccinations as well as self-antigens in pathological settings such as autoimmunity. However, it has now become clear that B cells can also secrete a vast array of cytokines, which influence both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Indeed, similarly to T cells, there is significant heterogeneity in cytokine-driven responses by B cells, ranging from the production of pro-inflammatory effector cytokines such as IL-6, through to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. In this review, focusing on human B cells, we summarize the key findings that have revealed that cytokine-producing B cell subsets have critical functions in healthy immune responses and contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.

## 1. OVERVIEW
### Main Research Objective
To provide a consolidated view of current understanding of human cytokine-producing B cells and their roles in health and disease.

### Central Question/Problem
How do B cells contribute to immune regulation through cytokine production, beyond their classical role as antibody-producing cells?

### Context and Relevance
- B cells were traditionally viewed only as antibody producers
- Research over 40 years has revealed their broader role in immune regulation through cytokine production
- Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This is a comprehensive review article that:
- Analyzes research conducted since the 1980s on human B cell cytokine production
- Examines studies on both healthy immune responses and autoimmune conditions
- Reviews evidence from in vitro studies, clinical samples, and therapeutic interventions

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

### Primary Discoveries
1. **Cytokine Production Capacity**:
   - Human B cells can produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines
   - Production is context-dependent and influenced by surrounding microenvironment
   - Different B cell subsets show distinct cytokine profiles

2. **Regulatory Functions**:
   - IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (Bregs) suppress inflammatory responses
   - Multiple Breg phenotypes exist with different surface markers
   - Bregs can suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses

3. **Disease Implications**:
   - Imbalance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory B cells contributes to autoimmune diseases
   - B cell depletion therapy efficacy may depend on modulating cytokine-producing subsets
   - Dysregulated cytokine networks observed in multiple autoimmune conditions

4. **Mechanistic Insights**:
   - Cytokine production triggered by various stimuli including CD40, toll-like receptors, and BCR signaling
   - Metabolic factors influence cytokine production
   - B cells show significant plasticity in their cytokine-producing capacity

### Practical Implications
- Better understanding of B cell-targeted therapies
- Potential for developing more selective therapeutic approaches
- Importance of considering cytokine production when evaluating treatment efficacy

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

### General Conclusions
1. B cells are not just antibody factories but crucial modulators of immune responses through cytokine production
2. The system is highly dynamic and context-dependent
3. No single transcription factor defines cytokine-producing subsets

### Practical Applications
- Development of more targeted B cell therapies
- Better prediction of treatment responses
- Potential for new therapeutic strategies targeting specific cytokine pathways

### Study Limitations
- Complexity of human B cell subsets makes definitive categorization difficult
- Challenge in determining exact signals controlling cytokine production in vivo
- Limited access to human tissue samples for studying tissue-resident B cells

## 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS
