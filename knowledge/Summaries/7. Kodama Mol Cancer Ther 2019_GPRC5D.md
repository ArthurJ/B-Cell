# Structured Summary: Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 Bispecific T-Cell-Redirecting Antibody for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 Bispecific T-Cell-Redirecting Antibody for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma
*   **Original Abstract:** Although treatment advances over recent decades have significantly improved survival of patients with multiple myeloma, there is still an unmet medical need for more effective treatments. In this study, we identified G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) expression on the surface of malignant cells involved in multiple myeloma, but except for plasma cells and B cells, not at appreciable levels on normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, we constructed IgG-based anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific T-cell-redirecting antibodies (GPRC5D TRAB), which suppressed the tumor growth of GPRC5D-positive myeloma cells through the activation of T cells in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. Collectively, these findings suggest that GPRC5D is an antigen specific to multiple myeloma and a potential target of TRAB therapy.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This study's objective was to validate G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) as a therapeutic target for multiple myeloma and to develop an effective immunotherapy against it. The central problem is the persistent need for novel, effective treatments for multiple myeloma, a largely incurable malignancy. This research is relevant because it identifies a highly specific tumor antigen and provides preclinical proof-of-concept for a new class of drug—a bispecific T-cell-redirecting antibody (TRAB)—that could offer a new treatment option for patients with this disease.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
The study first used microarray analysis to identify GPRC5D as highly expressed in malignant myeloma cells compared to normal B cells. The researchers then developed novel monoclonal antibodies to enable the detection of GPRC5D protein on the cell surface. Using these antibodies and flow cytometry, they analyzed GPRC5D expression on primary cells from multiple myeloma patients and various normal hematopoietic cell populations from healthy donors. Subsequently, they engineered an IgG-based bispecific T-cell-redirecting antibody (TRAB) designed to bind simultaneously to GPRC5D on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells. The efficacy of this GPRC5D TRAB was evaluated through *in vitro* T-cell activation and cytotoxicity assays and *in vivo* using mouse xenograft models of multiple myeloma.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **GPRC5D is specifically expressed on the surface of malignant myeloma cells.** Microarray and flow cytometry confirmed high GPRC5D expression in a majority (82%) of primary multiple myeloma patient samples. This expression was consistent with levels seen on myeloma cell lines (Figure 2A, 2C).
*   **GPRC5D expression is absent on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.** In contrast to its high expression on myeloma cells, GPRC5D was not detected on crucial normal hematopoietic populations, including CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), common myeloid progenitors, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (Figure 2G). It was also absent on mature T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and granulocytes.
*   **The engineered GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific antibody (TRAB) potently activates T cells in a target-dependent manner.** The GPRC5D TRAB successfully cross-linked T cells with GPRC5D-expressing myeloma cells, leading to robust T-cell activation, proliferation, and the secretion of effector cytokines such as IFNγ and TNF (Figure 4B).
*   **GPRC5D TRAB induces effective killing of myeloma cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*.** In co-culture assays, the TRAB mediated potent T-cell-dependent cytotoxicity against various GPRC5D-positive myeloma cell lines (Figure 4A). In multiple mouse xenograft models, a single dose of the GPRC5D TRAB resulted in significant and durable tumor regression, including complete responses in several animals (Figure 5).

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The study concludes that GPRC5D is an excellent, highly specific cell-surface antigen for multiple myeloma, with an expression pattern that is largely restricted to malignant cells. The anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific antibody effectively redirects T cells to eliminate GPRC5D-positive myeloma cells, demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. These findings strongly support the clinical development of GPRC5D-targeted TRAB therapy as a promising new treatment for multiple myeloma. A limitation is the lack of a suitable animal model for standard preclinical safety toxicology studies, as the antibodies did not cross-react with monkey GPRC5D.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D):** A novel cell-surface protein identified in this study as a highly specific tumor antigen on multiple myeloma cells.
    *   **Bispecific T-cell-Redirecting Antibody (TRAB):** An engineered antibody designed with two arms: one binds to a tumor antigen (GPRC5D) on a cancer cell, and the other binds to the CD3 complex on a T cell, forcing the T cell to kill the cancer cell.
    *   **Tumor-Specific Antigen:** A molecule that is highly expressed on cancer cells but has minimal to no expression on healthy, essential tissues, making it an ideal target for cancer therapy to minimize side effects.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Multiple Myeloma:** A cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell, which accumulate in the bone marrow.
    *   **Xenograft Model:** A laboratory animal model where human tumor cells are implanted into an immunodeficient mouse to study tumor growth and the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.
    *   **CD3 (Cluster of Differentiation 3):** A protein complex on the surface of T cells that is part of the T-cell receptor. It is a common target for immunotherapies designed to activate T cells.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This research provides the first confirmation of GPRC5D protein expression on the surface of primary multiple myeloma cells and establishes its high degree of tumor specificity by demonstrating its absence on hematopoietic stem cells.
    *   It presents the successful design and preclinical validation of a novel GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody, providing a strong rationale for its clinical application.
    *   The findings highlight a promising new therapeutic avenue for multiple myeloma, a disease with a significant unmet medical need.
