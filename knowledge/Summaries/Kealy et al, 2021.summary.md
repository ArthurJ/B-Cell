**Original Abstract**:
Immunological memory has the potential to provide lifelong protection against recurrent infections. As such, it has been crucial to the success of vaccines. Yet, the recent pandemic has illuminated key gaps in our knowledge related to the factors influencing effective memory formation and the inability to predict the longevity of immune protection. In recent decades, researchers have acquired a number of novel and powerful tools with which to study the factors underpinning humoral memory. These tools have been used to study the B-cell fate decisions that occur within the germinal centre (GC), a site where responding B cells undergo affinity maturation and are one of the major routes for memory B cell and high-affinity long-lived plasma cell formation. The advent of single-cell sequencing technology has provided an enhanced resolution for studying fate decisions within the GC and cutting-edge techniques have enabled researchers to model this reaction with more accuracy both in vitro and in silico. Moreover, modern approaches to studying memory B cells have allowed us to gain a better appreciation for the heterogeneity and adaptability of this vital class of B cells.

## 1. OVERVIEW
### Main Research Objective
To review recent advances in understanding how B-cell memory is formed and maintained in response to immunization or infection, with particular focus on SARS-CoV-2.

### Central Questions
- What factors influence effective memory formation?
