# Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 Bispecific T-Cell Redirecting Antibody for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma

## ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION

**Original Title**: Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 Bispecific T-Cell--Redirecting Antibody for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma

**Original Abstract**: 
Although treatment advances over recent decades have significantly improved survival of patients with multiple myeloma, there is still an unmet medical need for more effective treatments. In this study, we identified G-protein--coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) expression on the surface of malignant cells involved in multiple myeloma, but except for plasma cells and B cells, not at appreciable levels on normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, we constructed IgG-based anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific T-cell--redirecting antibodies (GPRC5D TRAB), which suppressed the tumor growth of GPRC5D-positive myeloma cells through the activation of T cells in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. Collectively, these findings suggest that GPRC5D is an antigen specific to multiple myeloma and a potential target of TRAB therapy.

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main Research Objective**: 
To develop and evaluate anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific antibodies for treating multiple myeloma by targeting GPRC5D-expressing malignant cells.

**Central Question/Problem**:
Can GPRC5D serve as a specific target for multiple myeloma treatment using bispecific antibody therapy?

**Context and Relevance**:
- Multiple myeloma remains incurable despite recent treatment advances
- Need for more effective and well-tolerated treatments
- GPRC5D shows potential as a specific target for multiple myeloma cells

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General Approach**:
- Development of anti-GPRC5D antibodies
- Creation of bispecific T-cell redirecting antibodies (TRABs)
- In vitro and in vivo testing of antibody efficacy

**Specific Tools and Methods**:
- Flow cytometry analysis
- Generation of GPRC5D-specific recombinant antibodies
- T-cell activation assays
- Cytotoxicity assays
- Mouse xenograft models

**Analyzed Data/Samples**:
- Multiple myeloma patient bone marrow samples
- Normal human hematopoietic cells
- Multiple myeloma cell lines
- Mouse xenograft models

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary Discoveries**:
1. GPRC5D is specifically expressed on multiple myeloma cells but not on normal hematopoietic cells (except plasma cells and B cells)
2. GPRC5D TRABs effectively activate T cells against GPRC5D-positive myeloma cells
3. The antibodies demonstrated significant tumor growth suppression in xenograft models
4. GPRC5D TRABs showed no cytotoxicity against normal bone marrow CD34+ cells

**Practical Implications**:
- GPRC5D represents a promising target for multiple myeloma therapy
- The developed antibodies show potential for clinical application
- The approach may be particularly beneficial for patients with t(4;14) translocation

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

**General Conclusions**:
- GPRC5D is a viable target for multiple myeloma treatment
- Anti-GPRC5D/CD3 bispecific antibodies effectively redirect T cells to target myeloma cells
- The treatment shows promise for clinical development

**Study Limitations**:
- Safety evaluation in animal models was challenging due to species-specific binding
- Alternative methods for nonclinical safety evaluation needed
- Long-term efficacy data not yet available
