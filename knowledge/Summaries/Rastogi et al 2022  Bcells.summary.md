- Original Title: Role of B cells as antigen presenting cells
- Original Abstract: B cells have been long studied for their role and function in the humoral immune system. Apart from generating antibodies and an antibody-mediated memory response against pathogens, B cells are also capable of generating cell-mediated immunity. It has been demonstrated by several groups that B cells can activate antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, and can have regulatory and cytotoxic effects. The function of B cells as professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to activate T cells has been largely understudied. This, however, requires attention as several recent reports have demonstrated the importance of B cells within the tumor microenvironment, and B cells are increasingly being evaluated as cellular therapies. Antigen presentation through B cells can be through antigen-specific (B cell receptor (BCR) dependent) or antigen non-specific (BCR independent) mechanisms and can be modulated by a variety of intrinsic and external factors. This review will discuss the pathways and mechanisms by which B cells present antigens, and how B cells differ from other professional APCs.

1. OVERVIEW

- Main research objective: To review the pathways and mechanisms by which B cells present antigens and to compare B cells with other professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
- Central question/problem: How do B cells function as APCs, and how does this compare to other APCs like dendritic cells? What are the implications for cancer immunotherapy?
- Context and relevance: B cells are primarily known for antibody production, but their role as APCs is gaining recognition, especially in the tumor microenvironment. Understanding this role is crucial for developing effective B cell-based immunotherapies.

2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

- General approach: This is a review article, so it synthesizes findings from a wide range of previously published studies.  It does not involve new experimental work.
- Specific tools and methods: The review discusses a variety of *in vitro* and *in vivo* experimental techniques used in the referenced studies, including:
  *  Flow cytometry (to identify and characterize B cell subsets and activation markers).
  *  Co-culture experiments (to assess B cell and T cell interactions).
  *  Mouse models (to study B cell function *in vivo*).
  *  Immunohistochemistry (to analyze tissue samples).
  *  Antigen pulsing and adoptive transfer experiments.
  * Gene expression studies.
- Analyzed data/samples: The review discusses data derived from human and mouse B cells, cell lines, and tumor samples.
- Relevant methodological innovations: The review highlights several innovative approaches, such as using CD40-activated B cells as APCs and manipulating B cells with cytokines and TLR agonists.

3. KEY FINDINGS

- Primary discoveries:
  *  Main findings addressing the central question: B cells can function as effective APCs, presenting antigens to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. B cell antigen presentation can occur via BCR-dependent (antigen-specific) and BCR-independent (antigen non-specific) mechanisms.
  *  Key results from the study:
     - B cells express MHC I and MHC II and possess the machinery for antigen uptake, processing, and presentation.
     - B cell activation and antigen presentation capacity can be enhanced by stimuli such as CD40 ligation, cytokines (IL-4, IFN-Î³), and TLR agonists (CpG ODN).
     - Different B cell subsets (B1, B2, Bregs) have varying APC capabilities.
     - Antigen presentation by B cells can lead to T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation.
  *  Secondary relevant findings:  The presence of infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is often associated with improved prognosis and response to immunotherapy in cancer.
  *  Unexpected results (if any): Not explicitly stated as "unexpected," but the review emphasizes the understudied nature of B cell APC function, implying that many findings are relatively new and still being explored.
- Practical implications of findings: The findings suggest that B cells could be exploited as cellular immunotherapies, either as vaccines or adjuvants, to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

- General conclusions: B cells are potent APCs capable of activating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and their APC function can be modulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
- Practical applications: B cells can be utilized in cancer immunotherapy as cellular vaccines or to enhance existing immunotherapies. Further research is needed to optimize B cell-based approaches.
- Study limitations: As a review, it is limited by the scope and quality of the studies it summarizes. It acknowledges gaps in knowledge, particularly regarding the mechanisms of MHC I antigen presentation by B cells and comparisons with other APCs.

5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

- Key concepts in the field:
  *  Antigen presentation: The process by which cells display antigens to T cells.
  *  Professional APCs: Specialized cells (DCs, macrophages, B cells) that prime and expand antigen-specific T cells.
  *  BCR: B cell receptor, responsible for antigen recognition and uptake.
  *  MHC I and MHC II: Major histocompatibility complex molecules that present antigens to T cells.
  *  Co-stimulation: Signals required for T cell activation, in addition to antigen presentation.
  *  TLS: Tertiary lymphoid structures, organized aggregates of immune cells in non-lymphoid tissues.
- Important technical terms: CpG ODN (oligodeoxynucleotides), BAFF (B cell-activating factor), TLR (Toll-like receptors), Breg (B regulatory cells).
- Innovative insights: The review highlights the potential of manipulating B cells *ex vivo* (e.g., with CD40 activation) to enhance their APC function for therapeutic purposes.
- Significant contributions to the area: The review synthesizes a growing body of literature on B cell APC function, highlighting its importance in anti-tumor immunity and its potential for cancer immunotherapy. It provides a comprehensive overview of the topic and identifies key areas for future research.
