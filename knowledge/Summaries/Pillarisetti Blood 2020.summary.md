# Paper Summary: A T-cell–redirecting bispecific G-protein–coupled receptor class 5 member D x CD3 antibody to treat multiple myeloma

## ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION

**Original Title**: A T-cell–redirecting bispecific G-protein–coupled receptor class 5 member D x CD3 antibody to treat multiple myeloma

**Original Abstract**: T-cell–mediated approaches have shown promise in myeloma treatment. However, there are currently a limited number of specific myeloma antigens that can be targeted, and multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. G-protein–coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D) is expressed in MM and smoldering MM patient plasma cells. Here, we demonstrate that GPRC5D protein is present on the surface of MM cells and describe JNJ-64407564, a GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific antibody that recruits CD3+ T cells to GPRC5D+ MM cells and induces killing of GPRC5D+ cells. In vitro, JNJ-64407564 induced specific cytotoxicity of GPRC5D+ cells with concomitant T-cell activation and also killed plasma cells in MM patient samples ex vivo. JNJ-64407564 can recruit T cells and induce tumor regression in GPRC5D+ MM murine models, which coincide with T-cell infiltration at the tumor site. This antibody is also able to induce cytotoxicity of patient primary MM cells from bone marrow, which is the natural site of this disease. GPRC5D is a promising surface antigen for MM immunotherapy, and JNJ-64407564 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory MM (NCT03399799).

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Main Research Objective**: To develop and evaluate a novel bispecific antibody (JNJ-64407564) targeting GPRC5D and CD3 for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

**Central Question/Problem**: Can GPRC5D serve as an effective target for T-cell-mediated immunotherapy in multiple myeloma, and can a bispecific antibody effectively redirect T cells to eliminate GPRC5D+ multiple myeloma cells?

**Context and Relevance**: Multiple myeloma remains incurable despite therapeutic advances. There is a critical need for new targets and treatment approaches, particularly as resistance to current therapies eventually develops.

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY

**General Approach**: 
- Development of a humanized bispecific antibody targeting GPRC5D and CD3
- Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluation of antibody efficacy
- Analysis of patient samples and xenograft models

**Specific Tools and Methods**:
- Flow cytometry for protein expression analysis
- T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays
- Cytokine measurements
- CRISPR knockout studies
- Xenograft mouse models
- Immunohistochemistry

**Analyzed Data/Samples**:
- Multiple myeloma cell lines
- Patient bone marrow samples
- Healthy donor blood samples
- Mouse xenograft models
- Normal tissue panels

**Methodological Innovations**:
- Development of JNJ-64407564, a novel bispecific antibody
- Use of CRISPR to generate GPRC5D and BCMA knockout cell lines
- Combined analysis of GPRC5D and BCMA expression

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

**Primary Discoveries**:

1. Main Findings Addressing Central Question:
- GPRC5D protein is specifically expressed on the surface of MM cells
- JNJ-64407564 effectively redirects T cells to kill GPRC5D+ MM cells
- The antibody shows activity in both cell lines and patient samples
- Demonstrates efficacy in xenograft models with tumor regression

2. Key Results:
- GPRC5D expression is heterogeneous but present in all 51 MM patients surveyed
- Antibody shows specific cytotoxicity with EC50 values of 0.008-0.15 nM
- Complete tumor responses observed in xenograft models at 10 and 50 μg doses
- T-cell infiltration correlates with anti-tumor activity

3. Secondary Relevant Findings:
- GPRC5D expression is independent of BCMA expression
- Limited expression in normal tissues except plasma cells
- No significant toxicity observed in cynomolgus monkey studies

4. Unexpected Results:
- GPRC5D protein levels on MM cells similar to normal plasma cells despite higher mRNA levels
- Activity maintained in BCMA knockout cells

**Practical Implications**:
- Potential new therapeutic option for MM patients
- Possible treatment for BCMA-resistant disease
- May be effective in early disease stages (smoldering MM)

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS

**General Conclusions**:
- GPRC5D is a viable target for MM immunotherapy
- JNJ-64407564 shows promising preclinical efficacy
- The bispecific antibody approach effectively recruits T cells
- Activity is specific and dependent on GPRC5D expression

**Practical Applications**:
