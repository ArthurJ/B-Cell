- **Original Abstract**: B cells are classically considered solely as antibody-producing cells driving humoral immune responses to foreign antigens in infections and vaccinations as well as self-antigens in pathological settings such as autoimmunity. However, it has now become clear that B cells can also secrete a vast array of cytokines, which influence both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Indeed, similarly to T cells, there is significant heterogeneity in cytokine-driven responses by B cells, ranging from the production of pro-inflammatory effector cytokines such as IL-6, through to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. In this review, focusing on human B cells, we summarize the key findings that have revealed that cytokine-producing B cell subsets have critical functions in healthy immune responses and contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.

## 1. OVERVIEW
- **Main Research Objective**: To provide a consolidated review of current understanding of cytokine-producing human B cells and their roles in health and disease
- **Central Question/Problem**: How do B cells contribute to immune regulation through cytokine production beyond their classical antibody-producing role?
- **Context and Relevance**: 
  - B cells were traditionally viewed only as antibody producers
  - Recent research reveals their broader role in immune regulation through cytokine production
  - Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for treating autoimmune diseases

## 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
- **General Approach**: Comprehensive literature review focusing on human B cell studies
- **Analyzed Data/Sources**: 
  - Historical studies from the 1980s onward
  - Recent clinical and experimental research
  - Studies on autoimmune diseases and B cell depletion therapy
- **Key Areas Examined**:
  - B cell development and differentiation
  - Cytokine production mechanisms
  - Role in immune regulation
  - Impact on autoimmune diseases

## 3. KEY FINDINGS
- **Primary Discoveries**:
  1. B cells produce diverse cytokines that can be both pro- and anti-inflammatory
  2. Cytokine production is context-dependent and influenced by environmental stimuli
  3. Multiple B cell subsets show polyfunctionality in cytokine production
  4. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) produce IL-10 and other immunosuppressive cytokines
  
- **Practical Implications**:
  - Dysregulation of B cell cytokine production contributes to autoimmune diseases
  - B cell depletion therapy efficacy may depend on cytokine-producing subsets
  - Potential for developing more targeted therapeutic approaches

## 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
- **General Conclusions**:
  - B cells are not just antibody factories but crucial cytokine producers
  - Their cytokine production significantly influences immune responses
  - B cell-derived cytokines play vital roles in both health and disease

- **Study Limitations**:
  - Complex nature of cytokine networks makes precise mechanism identification challenging
  - Limited access to human tissue samples
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between different B cell subsets

- **Practical Applications**:
  - Improved understanding for autoimmune disease treatment
  - Development of more selective B cell-targeted therapies
  - Potential applications beyond autoimmunity
