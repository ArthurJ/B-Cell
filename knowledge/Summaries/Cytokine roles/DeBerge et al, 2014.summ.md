# Soluble, but not transmembrane, TNF-α is required during influenza infection to limit the magnitude of immune responses and the extent of immunopathology

**Original Abstract:**
TNF-α is a pleotropic cytokine, which has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions during influenza infection. TNF-α is first expressed as a transmembrane (mem) protein that is proteolytically processed to release a soluble (sol) form. memTNF-α and solTNF-α have been shown to exert distinct tissue-protective or -pathologic effects in several disease models. However, the relative contributions of memTNF-α or solTNF-α in regulating pulmonary immunopathology following influenza infection are unclear. Therefore, we performed intranasal influenza infection in mice exclusively expressing non-cleavable memTNF-α or lacking TNF-α entirely and examined the outcomes. We found that solTNF-α, but not memTNF-α, was required to limit the size of the immune response and the extent of injury. In the absence of solTNF-α, there was a significant increase in the CD8+ T-cell response, including virus-specific CD8+ T-cells, which was due in part to an increased resistance to activation-induced cell death. We found that solTNF-α mediates these immunoregulatory effects primarily through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), since mice deficient in TNFR1, but not TNFR2, exhibited dysregulated immune responses and exacerbated injury similar to that observed in mice lacking solTNF-α. We also found that solTNF-α expression was required early during infection to regulate the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response indicating that early inflammatory events are critical for the regulation of the effector phase. Taken together, these findings suggest that processing of memTNF-α to release solTNF-α is a critical event regulating the immune response during influenza infection.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This research article investigates the distinct roles of soluble TNF-α (solTNF-α) and transmembrane TNF-α (memTNF-α) in regulating immune responses and immunopathology during influenza A virus infection in mice. The central question is whether the proteolytic processing of memTNF-α to release solTNF-α is necessary for the previously observed immunoregulatory (protective) effects of TNF-α during influenza infection. The study aims to determine which form of TNF-α (soluble or membrane-bound) is responsible for limiting the magnitude of the immune response and reducing lung injury.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

The researchers used a combination of *in vivo* mouse models and *in vitro* cellular assays:

*   **Mouse Models:**
    *   Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice.
    *   TNF-α knockout (TNF-/-) mice.
    *   Mice expressing only non-cleavable memTNF-α (memTNFΔ1–9, K11E KI). These mice cannot produce solTNF-α.
    *   TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- mice (deficient in TNF receptor 1 or 2).
*   **Influenza Infection:** Mice were infected intranasally with a sub-lethal dose of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus.
*   **Morbidity and Lung Injury Assessment:**
    *   Weight loss was monitored as a measure of morbidity.
    *   Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured.
    *   Lung histology (H&E staining) was performed to assess inflammation and tissue damage.
    *   Albumin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured as an indicator of vascular leakage and lung injury.
*   **Immune Cell Analysis:**
    *   Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue were harvested to analyze immune cell infiltration and cytokine/chemokine levels.
    *   Flow cytometry was used to quantify and characterize different immune cell populations (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils), including virus-specific CD8+ T cells (using tetramers for NP366–374 and PA224–233 epitopes).
    *  Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using ELISA and Luminex assays.
*   **Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) Assays:**
    *   *In vitro* restimulation of CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 to assess apoptosis (annexin V staining) and Bcl-2 expression.
*   **Adoptive Transfer Experiments:**
    * Transferring WT and TNFR1-/- CD8 T-cells into congenic mice to assess the role of TNFR1 signaling.
*  **Antibody treatments:**
    * Anti-TNF-α, anti-CD8a, IgG control.
*  **Viral Titers:**
    *  TCID50 assay in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **solTNF-α, Not memTNF-α, Protects Against Lung Injury:** Mice lacking solTNF-α (memTNFΔ1–9, K11E KI) and TNF-/- mice showed increased morbidity (weight loss), lung injury (histology, albumin leakage), and reduced oxygen saturation compared to WT mice.  This indicates that solTNF-α, but not memTNF-α, is required for protection.
*   **TNF-α is Dispensable for Viral Clearance:**  All mouse strains, regardless of TNF-α status, were able to clear the virus from the lungs by day 14 post-infection.
*   **solTNF-α Limits Immune Cell Infiltration and Cytokine Production:**  In the absence of solTNF-α, there was increased infiltration of immune cells (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils) into the lungs and airways.  Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-15, CCL2, CXCL10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, G-CSF) were also elevated.
*   **solTNF-α Limits the CD8+ T-Cell Response:** Mice lacking solTNF-α had a significantly larger CD8+ T-cell response, including a greater number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells.
*   **TNFR1 Mediates the Immunoregulatory Effects of solTNF-α:**  TNFR1-/- mice, but not TNFR2-/- mice, recapitulated the phenotype of solTNF-α-deficient mice, showing increased morbidity, lung injury, and enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses.
*   **solTNF-α Reduces AICD of CD8+ T Cells:**  CD8+ T cells from mice lacking solTNF-α were more resistant to activation-induced cell death (AICD) *in vitro*, and expressed higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  This suggests that solTNF-α normally promotes AICD to limit the CD8+ T-cell response.
* **Early solTNF-α Expression is Critical:**  Neutralizing TNF-α early during infection (days -1, 1, and 3) but not later (days 5 and 7) phenocopied the effects. Administration of recombinant solTNF-α to memTNF-α mice reduced cellular infiltration.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

The study demonstrates that soluble TNF-α, signaling primarily through TNFR1, plays a crucial *immunoregulatory* role during influenza infection.  It limits the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response, likely by promoting activation-induced cell death, and thereby reduces the extent of lung injury and immunopathology.  The timing of solTNF-α expression is critical, with early expression being necessary for its protective effects.  The findings challenge the traditional view of TNF-α as solely a pro-inflammatory cytokine and highlight its complex, context-dependent roles in the immune response.
