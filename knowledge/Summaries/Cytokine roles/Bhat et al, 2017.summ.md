# Interferon-γ derived from cytotoxic lymphocytes directly enhances their motility and cytotoxicity

**Original Abstract:** Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a key moderator of cell-mediated immunity with diverse, mainly pro-inflammatory actions on immunocytes and target tissue. Recent studies have shown it may enhance anti-tumor and antiviral effects of CD8 T cells. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which IFNγ mediates CD8 T-cell cytotoxic function. We show that *in vivo*, antigen-specific CD8 T cells that produce INFγ are necessary to effect rejection of skin grafts expressing OVA as a transgene in keratinocytes. The ability of CD8 T cells to produce IFNγ enhanced their ability to migrate to the site of antigen-presenting skin cells. By *in vivo* imaging, we show that CTL motility, particularly speed, during graft rejection was enhanced by locally available IFNγ. We then used a reductionist two-cell model of CTL effectors and keratinocyte targets to investigate the effects of locally available (paracrine) and CTL-producing (autocrine) IFNγ on the motility behavior and killing ability of the CTL. Using live-cell imaging by prolonged time-lapse microscopy of primary effector CD8 T cells and antigen-expressing primary keratinocyte targets, we show that CD8 T-cell cytotoxic function and motility is enhanced by locally available IFNγ. Conversely, deprivation of either autocrine or paracrine IFNγ, or blockade of IFNγ signaling to CTL markedly reduced their cytotoxic function, their kinematics, and effector cell survival. We conclude that *in vitro* and *in vivo*, autocrine production of IFNγ by CTL enhances their motility and promotes killing of primary target keratinocytes. The absolute need for local IFNγ to enable cytotoxic CD8 T-cell function is of significance for immunotherapy for chronic viral infection and for cancer.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This study investigates the role of Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) in modulating the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs). The central question is how IFNγ, both produced by CTLs (autocrine) and present in the environment (paracrine), affects CTL motility and their ability to kill target cells. The research is relevant to understanding immune responses in cancer and chronic viral infections, where enhancing CTL function is a therapeutic goal. The context is that, while IFNγ is known to have diverse pro-inflammatory effects, its precise role in CTL-mediated killing needed further investigation.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

The researchers used a combination of *in vivo* and *in vitro* approaches. *In vivo*, they employed a skin graft model in mice, where skin expressing ovalbumin (OVA) was grafted onto recipient mice.  They used adoptive transfer of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells and tracked cell migration and graft rejection.  They also performed intravital two-photon microscopy to visualize CTL motility within the graft tissue.  *In vitro*, they developed a two-cell co-culture system with primary mouse keratinocytes (as target cells) and primary mouse CD8+ T cells (as effectors). Live-cell time-lapse microscopy was used to analyze CTL motility and killing of keratinocytes.  IFNγ levels were manipulated using recombinant IFNγ, anti-IFNγ antibodies, and IFNγ-deficient or IFNγR-deficient cells.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   *In vivo*, IFNγ production by CD8+ T cells was essential for the rejection of skin grafts expressing OVA.
*   IFNγ enhanced the migration of CD8+ T cells to the site of antigen-presenting skin cells, and increased CTL motility (particularly speed) during graft rejection.
*   *In vitro*, both autocrine and paracrine IFNγ enhanced the cytotoxic function and motility of CD8+ T cells.
*   Deprivation of IFNγ (either autocrine or paracrine) or blockade of IFNγ signaling significantly reduced CTL cytotoxic function, kinematics, and survival.
*   Figure 2 shows that, in the absence of acute inflammation and after antigen loss, the displacement, travel length and, importantly, speed of CTL is significantly different between IFNy-competent mice and IFNy-deficient counterparts.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

The study concludes that IFNγ, particularly when produced by the CTLs themselves (autocrine signaling), plays a crucial role in enhancing CTL motility and promoting the killing of target cells. Local IFNγ is essential for effective cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell function. The study's limitations include the use of a specific antigen (OVA) and a focus on keratinocytes as target cells; the findings may not generalize to all cell types or antigens.  The research has practical applications in the development of immunotherapies for cancer and chronic viral infections.

**5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS**

*   **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs):**  A type of immune cell (CD8+ T cell) that can kill other cells, such as infected or cancerous cells.
*   **Interferon-gamma (IFNγ):** A cytokine (signaling molecule) that plays a key role in the immune system, particularly in activating immune cells and promoting inflammation.
*   **Autocrine signaling:**  A form of cell signaling where a cell secretes a molecule (in this case, IFNγ) that binds to receptors on the same cell, affecting its own function.
*   **Paracrine signaling:** A form of cell signaling where a cell secretes a molecule that affects nearby cells.
*   **Kinematics:** In this context, refers to the movement characteristics of the CTLs, such as speed and displacement.
*   **Novel Insight:** The study provides direct evidence that autocrine IFNγ production by CTLs is critical for enhancing their motility and cytotoxic function, highlighting a self-regulatory mechanism. A significant contribution is the demonstration of the *in vivo* and *in vitro* effects of IFNγ on CTL kinematics.
