# The multifaceted nature of IL-10: regulation, role in immunological homeostasis and its relevance to cancer, COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions

**Original Abstract:** Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a fundamental role in modulating inflammation and in maintaining cell homeostasis. It primarily acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, protecting the body from an uncontrolled immune response, mostly through the Jak1/Tyk2 and STAT3 signaling pathway. On the other hand, IL-10 can also have immunostimulating functions under certain conditions. Given the pivotal role of IL-10 in immune modulation, this cytokine could have relevant implications in pathologies characterized by hyperinflammatory state, such as cancer, or infectious diseases as in the case of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 syndrome. Recent evidence proposed IL-10 as a predictor of severity and mortality for patients with acute or post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, IL-10 can act as an endogenous danger signal, released by tissues undergoing damage in an attempt to protect the organism from harmful hyperinflammation. Pharmacological strategies aimed to potentiate or restore IL-10 immunomodulatory action may represent novel promising avenues to counteract cytokine storm arising from hyperinflammation and effectively mitigate severe complications. Natural bioactive compounds, derived from terrestrial or marine photosynthetic organisms and able to increase IL-10 expression, could represent a useful prevention strategy to curb inflammation through IL-10 elevation and will be discussed here. However, the multifaceted nature of IL-10 has to be taken into account in the attempts to modulate its levels.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article summarizes the current understanding of Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a pleiotropic cytokine with crucial roles in immune regulation and homeostasis. The review focuses on IL-10's dual nature, acting as both an anti-inflammatory and, in specific contexts, an immunostimulatory factor. It explores IL-10's involvement in various pathological conditions, notably cancer and COVID-19 (including post-COVID conditions). The review also considers the potential therapeutic implications of modulating IL-10 levels and highlights the effects of natural products. The central question addressed is how IL-10's diverse and sometimes opposing actions influence health and disease, particularly in states of hyperinflammation.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

This is a review article, meaning it synthesizes and analyzes findings from previously published research.  It does not present original experimental data. The review draws upon a broad range of studies, including:

*   **In vitro studies:** Cell culture experiments examining IL-10 production, signaling, and effects on various cell types (immune cells, epithelial cells, etc.).
*   **In vivo studies:** Animal models (primarily mice) of infection, inflammation, cancer, and other diseases.
*   **Human clinical studies:**  Observational studies and clinical trials investigating IL-10 levels and their correlation with disease severity, outcomes, and responses to therapies.
* **Molecular biology techniques:** Studies analyzing gene expression, protein structure, signaling pathways, and post-translational modifications.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **IL-10 Structure and Signaling:** IL-10 is a homodimeric cytokine that signals primarily through the Jak1/Tyk2-STAT3 pathway. It also signals, to a lesser extent, through STAT1 and STAT5, and can activate PI3K/Akt pathways. The IL-10 receptor complex (IL-10R) is heterotetrameric.
*   **IL-10 Cellular Sources:** IL-10 is produced by a wide variety of immune cells (including T helper cell subsets, Tregs, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, NK cells) and some non-immune cells.
*   **IL-10's Dual Role:**
    *   **Anti-inflammatory/Immunosuppressive:** IL-10 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppresses antigen presentation, limits T cell activation, and promotes regulatory T cell function.
    *   **Immunostimulatory:** IL-10 can enhance B cell survival and differentiation, promote cytotoxic T cell activity, and stimulate NK cells.
*   **IL-10 in Disease:**
    *   **Infections:** IL-10 can limit immunopathology but also impair pathogen clearance, leading to chronic infections.
    *   **Cancer:** IL-10 can both promote and suppress tumor growth, depending on the context.
    *   **COVID-19:** Elevated IL-10 levels are associated with severe COVID-19, potentially reflecting a counter-regulatory response to hyperinflammation, but also possibly contributing to immune suppression.
    *  **Post-COVID Conditions**: The role is not yet clear
    * **Other**: Elevated in several autoimmune conditions, where it *may* play a regulatory role.
*   **Regulation of IL-10 Production:** IL-10 production is tightly regulated at multiple levels (transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and secretory).
*   **Therapeutic Implications:**
    *   IL-10 itself has been tested in clinical trials, with mixed results.
    *   Targeting IL-10 signaling pathways (e.g., with JAK inhibitors) is being explored.
    *   Natural compounds that can modulate IL-10 production are of interest.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

IL-10 is a critical cytokine with complex and context-dependent roles in immune regulation. It can both suppress and promote immune responses, making it a challenging therapeutic target.  The review emphasizes that IL-10's effects depend on the specific cellular source, timing, location, and the presence of other immune signals.  In the context of COVID-19, IL-10's role is complex, potentially reflecting both a beneficial anti-inflammatory response and a detrimental immunosuppressive effect.  Further research is needed to fully understand IL-10's diverse functions and to develop effective strategies for modulating its activity for therapeutic benefit.
