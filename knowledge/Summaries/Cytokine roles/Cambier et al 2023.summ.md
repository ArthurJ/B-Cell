# The chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL12: molecular and functional properties, role in disease and efforts towards pharmacological intervention

**Original Abstract:** Chemokines are an indispensable component of our immune system through the regulation of directional migration and activation of leukocytes. CXCL8 is the most potent human neutrophil-attracting chemokine and plays crucial roles in the response to infection and tissue injury. CXCL8 activity inherently depends on interaction with the human CXC chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR1, and glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, (hetero)dimerization and tight regulation of transcription and translation, as well as post-translational modifications further fine-tune the spatial and temporal activity of CXCL8 in the context of inflammatory diseases and cancer. The CXCL8 interaction with receptors and glycosaminoglycans is therefore a promising target for therapy, as illustrated by multiple ongoing clinical trials. CXCL8-mediated neutrophil mobilization to blood is directly opposed by CXCL12, which retains leukocytes in bone marrow. CXCL12 is primarily a homeostatic chemokine that induces migration and activation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial cells, and several leukocytes through interaction with CXCR4, ACKR1, and ACKR3. Thereby, it is an essential player in the regulation of embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and angiogenesis. However, CXCL12 can also exert inflammatory functions, as illustrated by its pivotal role in a growing list of pathologies and its synergy with CXCL8 and other chemokines to induce leukocyte chemotaxis. Here, we review the plethora of information on the CXCL8 structure, interaction with receptors and glycosaminoglycans, different levels of activity regulation, role in homeostasis and disease, and therapeutic prospects. Finally, we discuss recent research on CXCL12 biochemistry and biology and its role in pathology and pharmacology.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article comprehensively summarizes current knowledge regarding the chemokines CXCL8 (Interleukin-8, IL-8) and CXCL12 (Stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF-1).  The central focus is on their molecular structures, functional properties, roles in both homeostasis and disease, and the development of pharmacological interventions targeting these chemokines and their receptors. The authors highlight the distinct roles of CXCL8 as a primarily inflammatory chemokine and CXCL12 as a chemokine with both homeostatic and inflammatory functions. The review emphasizes the complex regulation of chemokine activity at multiple levels, including receptor interactions, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding, and post-translational modifications.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

This is a review article; therefore, no original experimental methodology is presented.  The review synthesizes information from a wide range of published studies, including *in vitro* biochemical and cell-based assays, *in vivo* animal models (primarily mice), and human clinical trials. The methodologies mentioned include:

*   **Structural studies:**  NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
*   **Biochemical assays:**  ELISA, western blotting, chromatography, surface plasmon resonance.
*   **Cell-based assays:** Chemotaxis assays, calcium mobilization assays, receptor binding assays, signaling pathway analysis.
*   **Animal models:**  Genetically modified mice (knockouts, cell-specific deletions), models of inflammatory diseases (e.g., arthritis, asthma, sepsis), cancer models (xenografts, transgenic models).
*  **Human clinical trials:** Phase I, II and III testing new drugs.
*  **Advanced detection methods:** Immuno-sorbent nano-scale liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry proteoform analysis (ISTAMPA)

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **CXCL8:**
    *   Primarily an inflammatory chemokine, potently attracting and activating neutrophils.
    *   Signals through CXCR1 and CXCR2 (G protein-coupled receptors) and interacts with ACKR1 (an atypical chemokine receptor) and GAGs.
    *   Activity is regulated by GAG binding, dimerization, and post-translational modifications (proteolysis, citrullination, nitration).  Proteolytic N-terminal truncation *increases* CXCL8 activity.
    *   Plays crucial roles in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD, arthritis), and cancer (promoting angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion).
    * The monomer form has the highest affinity for the receptors.
    *   Multiple clinical trials targeting CXCL8 or its receptors are ongoing, but with limited success so far.

*   **CXCL12:**
    *   Has both homeostatic and inflammatory roles.
    *   Signals through CXCR4 and ACKR3, and also interacts with ACKR1 and GAGs.
    *   Homeostatic functions include hematopoiesis, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and leukocyte trafficking.
    *   Inflammatory roles include leukocyte recruitment and activation; can synergize with CXCL8.
    *   Activity is regulated by GAG binding, dimerization, and post-translational modifications (proteolysis, citrullination, nitration).  All known post-translational modifications *reduce* or *abolish* CXCL12 activity.
    *   Involved in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and inflammatory diseases.
    *   Multiple clinical trials are ongoing or completed, with some success (e.g., plerixafor/AMD3100 for stem cell mobilization).

*  **General to Both:**
    * GAG binding and dimerization regulate the formation of chemokine concentration gradients.
    *   The two-step/two-site model of chemokine-receptor interaction is likely too simplified.
    * Box 1 lists key areas of novel research.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

CXCL8 and CXCL12 are crucial regulators of immune responses and have complex, context-dependent roles in both health and disease.  Their activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels. Targeting these chemokines or their receptors holds therapeutic promise, but a deeper understanding of their complex biology is needed to develop effective and specific interventions.  The authors emphasize the need for further research to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action, the roles of different proteoforms and post-translational modifications, and the context-specific effects of these chemokines in various diseases. They also highlight the challenges of translating findings from animal models to human therapies.

**5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS**

*   **Chemokines:** Small, secreted proteins that act as chemoattractants, guiding the migration of cells, particularly leukocytes.
*   **CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, ACKR1, ACKR3:**  Receptors for CXCL8 and/or CXCL12. CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4 are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular signaling pathways.  ACKR1 and ACKR3 are atypical chemokine receptors that do not signal through G proteins but can scavenge chemokines or promote transcytosis.
*   **Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs):**  Large, linear polysaccharides found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix.  They bind chemokines, immobilizing them and forming concentration gradients.
*   **Post-translational Modifications:**  Chemical modifications to proteins after they are synthesized, such as proteolysis (cleavage), citrullination (conversion of arginine to citrulline), and nitration (addition of a nitro group).
*   **ISTAMPA:** Immuno-sorbent nano-scale liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry proteoform analysis.  A new method for detecting and quantifying different proteoforms of chemokines.
* **Novel Insights/Contributions**: Detailed examination of the current state of chemokine therapeutic targeting research and an examination of multiple, parallel approaches.
