# IL-35 Regulates the Function of Immune Cells in Tumor Microenvironment

**Original Abstract:**
Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and IL-12p35 that has recently been shown to play diverse and important roles in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to its immunosuppressive activity and ability to promote tumor growth and progression, IL-35 is widely recognized as a key mediator of TME status. Immune cells are key mediators of diverse tumor-related phenotypes, and immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-35 can promote tumor growth and metastasis in TME. These influences should be considered together. Since tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade remains ineffective in many patients due to tumoral resistance, a new target or efficacy enhancing factor is urgently needed. Suppressing IL-35 production and activity has been demonstrated as an effective factor that inhibits tumor cells viability, and further investigation of this cytokine is warranted. However, the mechanistic basis for IL-35-mediated regulation of immune cells in the TME remains to be fully clarified. In the present review, we explore the roles of IL-35 in regulating immune cells within the TME. In addition, we highlight IL-35 as a specific immunological target and discuss its possible relevance in the context of immunotherapy. Lastly, we sought to summarize potential future research directions that may guide the advancement of current understanding regarding the role of this important cytokine as a regulator of oncogenesis.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article summarizes the current understanding of Interleukin-35 (IL-35) and its role in regulating immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). It focuses on IL-35's immunosuppressive functions and its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. The central questions addressed are: how does IL-35 influence different immune cell populations within the TME, and how can this knowledge be leveraged for therapeutic benefit?

As a review article, this paper does not present original experimental methods. It synthesizes and analyzes existing research from various sources, including:

*   **In vitro studies:** Cell culture experiments investigating the effects of IL-35 on immune cells and tumor cells.
*   **In vivo studies:** Animal models (primarily mice) of cancer, examining the impact of IL-35 on tumor growth, metastasis, and immune responses.
*   **Human studies:** Analysis of patient samples (e.g., tumor tissue, blood) to assess IL-35 expression and its correlation with clinical outcomes.
* **Molecular biology techniques**: Methods to study IL-35 signaling pathways.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **IL-35 Structure and Signaling:** IL-35 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of EBI3 and IL-12p35 subunits. It signals through a receptor complex consisting of gp130 and IL-12RÎ²2, activating STAT1 and STAT4.
*   **IL-35 Sources:** IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, endothelial cells and can be expressed by tumor cells.
*   **IL-35 Immunosuppressive Functions:**
    *   Suppresses proliferation and function of effector T cells (Th1, Th17, CTLs).
    *   Promotes expansion and function of Tregs and Bregs.
    *   Inhibits dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation.
    *  Can polarize macrophages toward a pro-tumoral M2 phenotype.
    *  Can recruit and activate myeloid derived supressor cells (MDSC).
*   **IL-35 and Tumor Progression:**
    *   IL-35 promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in various cancers (HCC, breast cancer, PDAC, NSCLC, prostate cancer, etc.).
    *   IL-35 contributes to an immunosuppressive TME, hindering anti-tumor immune responses.
    *   IL-35 can induce T-cell exhaustion and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.
* **IL-35 interaction with other factors:**
    *  IL-35 production can be enhanced by Tregs.
    *  IL-35 and PD-1/PD-L1 have complex interactions, that may either enhance or decrease anti-tumor immunity.
* **IL-35 and B-Cells:**
    * IL-35 promotes conversion of regular B-cells into i35-Bregs.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

IL-35 is a key regulator of the tumor microenvironment, primarily acting as an immunosuppressive cytokine that promotes tumor growth and progression.  It exerts its effects by modulating the activity of various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, DCs, macrophages, and others.  Targeting IL-35 may represent a promising strategy for enhancing anti-tumor immunity and improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.
