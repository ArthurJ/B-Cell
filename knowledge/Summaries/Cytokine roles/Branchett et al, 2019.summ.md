# Regulatory cytokine function in the respiratory tract

**Original Abstract:** The respiratory tract is an important site of immune regulation; required to allow protective immunity against pathogens, while minimizing tissue damage and avoiding aberrant inflammatory responses to inhaled allergens. Several cell types work in concert to control pulmonary immune responses and maintain tolerance in the respiratory tract, including regulatory and effector T cells, airway and interstitial macrophages, dendritic cells and the airway epithelium. The cytokines transforming growth factor β, interleukin (IL-) 10, IL-27, and IL-35 are key coordinators of immune regulation in tissues such as the lung. Here, we discuss the role of these cytokines during respiratory infection and allergic airway disease, highlighting the critical importance of cellular source and immunological context for the effects of these cytokines *in vivo*.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article summarizes the current understanding of the roles of key regulatory cytokines – transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-27, and IL-35 – in the respiratory tract.  The central question is how these cytokines coordinate immune responses in the lung, balancing protective immunity against pathogens with the need to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage, particularly in the context of respiratory infections and allergic airway disease (AAD). The review emphasizes that the effects of these cytokines are highly dependent on their cellular source and the specific immunological context. The relevance is to understand the complex immune regulation in the lung and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

This is a review article, so it does not present new experimental data. Instead, it synthesizes findings from a wide range of published studies.  The methodologies discussed are diverse and include *in vivo* studies using genetically modified mice (knockouts, cell-specific deletions), *in vitro* cell culture experiments, human clinical studies, and analysis of human samples (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue). The review discusses various experimental models, including models of respiratory infection (influenza, RSV, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, etc.) and allergic airway disease (using allergens like ovalbumin and house dust mite).

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **TGF-β:**  Has diverse, context-dependent roles. It can suppress protective immunity (e.g., inhibiting IFN-β responses to influenza), but also limit immunopathology.  In AAD, it can both suppress type 2 inflammation and promote airway remodeling.  Its effects depend on the cellular source and activation mechanism (e.g., via integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8).
*   **IL-10:** Primarily acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. It can limit immunopathology during respiratory infections, but may also impair pathogen clearance.  In AAD, it can suppress Th2 responses, but its role is complex and model-dependent.  T cells are a key source, but other cells (macrophages, DCs) also contribute.
*   **IL-27:**  Has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It can promote Th1 responses (pro-inflammatory) but also induce IL-10 production and suppress Th17 and Th2 responses (anti-inflammatory).  Its role in respiratory infections and AAD depends on the specific context.
*   **IL-35:**  Primarily an immunosuppressive cytokine, mainly produced by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and B cells (Bregs).  It can suppress Teff proliferation and Th17 development.  Its role in the respiratory tract is less well-defined compared to the other cytokines, but studies suggest it can suppress allergic airway inflammation.

    *   The effects of all four cytokines are highly dependent on the *cellular source* and the *immunological context*.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

The review concludes that TGF-β, IL-10, IL-27, and IL-35 are crucial regulators of immune responses in the respiratory tract, playing complex and often context-dependent roles in balancing protective immunity, immunopathology, and tissue repair. The precise effects of each cytokine depend on factors such as the specific pathogen or allergen, the route of exposure, the cellular source of the cytokine, and the presence of other immune signals. Understanding these complex interactions is critical for developing effective therapies for respiratory diseases. Further research is needed, particularly to dissect the roles of different cellular sources of these cytokines *in vivo*.

**5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS**

*   **Regulatory Cytokines:** Signaling molecules that modulate the immune system, often suppressing immune responses to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Key examples are TGF-β, IL-10, IL-27, and IL-35.
*   **Immunopathology:** Tissue damage caused by an excessive or inappropriate immune response.
*   **Airway Remodeling:** Structural changes in the airways that occur in chronic inflammatory diseases like asthma, including thickening of the airway wall and increased mucus production.
*   **Th1, Th2, Th17 cells:** Different subsets of CD4+ T helper cells that produce distinct sets of cytokines and have different roles in immunity. Th1 cells are generally involved in responses to intracellular pathogens, Th2 cells in responses to parasites and allergens, and Th17 cells in responses to extracellular bacteria and fungi.
*   **Tregs (Regulatory T cells):** A subset of T cells that suppress immune responses and maintain immune tolerance.
*  **Novel Insights:** The review highlights the context-dependent nature of cytokine. Specifically emphasizing the effects of cell of origin on overall outcomes.
