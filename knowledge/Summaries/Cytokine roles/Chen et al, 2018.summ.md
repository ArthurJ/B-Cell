# Host Immune Response to Influenza A Virus Infection

**Original Abstract:** Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are contagious pathogens responsible for severe respiratory infection in humans and animals worldwide. Upon detection of IAV infection, host immune system aims to defend against and clear the viral infection. Innate immune system is comprised of physical barriers (mucus and collectins), various phagocytic cells, group of cytokines, interferons (IFNs), and IFN-stimulated genes, which provide first line of defense against IAV infection. The adaptive immunity is mediated by B cells and T cells, characterized with antigen-specific memory cells, capturing and neutralizing the pathogen. The humoral immune response functions through hemagglutinin-specific circulating antibodies to neutralize IAV. In addition, antibodies can bind to the surface of infected cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement activation. Although there are neutralizing antibodies against the virus, cellular immunity also plays a crucial role in the fight against IAVs. On the other hand, IAVs have developed multiple strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we discuss how immune system, especially innate immune system and critical molecules are involved in the antiviral defense against IAVs. In addition, we highlight how IAVs antagonize different immune responses to achieve a successful infection.

**1. OVERVIEW**

This review article summarizes the host immune response to Influenza A virus (IAV) infection, focusing on both innate and adaptive immunity. It describes the mechanisms by which the host detects and combats IAV, as well as the strategies IAV uses to evade these defenses.  The central question is how the host immune system, particularly the innate immune system, interacts with IAV, and how the virus counteracts these responses to establish a successful infection.

**2. MAIN METHODOLOGY**

As a review article, this paper does not present original experimental methods. It synthesizes and analyzes data from a wide range of previously published studies.  The methodologies implicitly discussed include:

*   **In vitro studies:** Cell culture experiments, biochemical assays, and molecular biology techniques to study virus-host interactions.
*   **In vivo studies:** Animal models (primarily mice) of influenza infection.
*   **Human studies:**  Analysis of samples from infected individuals, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials.
*   **Structural biology:** Techniques like X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to determine the structures of viral and host proteins.

**3. KEY FINDINGS**

*   **IAV Entry and Initial Recognition:** IAV primarily infects airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Viral entry is mediated by hemagglutinin (HA) binding to sialic acid (SA) receptors on host cells.  Different IAV subtypes have preferences for different SA types (α2-3 vs. α2-6), influencing tissue tropism and species specificity.
*   **Innate Immune Response:**
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Mucus and mucins act as the first line of defense.
    *   **Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs):**  Host cells detect viral components (PAMPs) via PRRs, including:
        *   **RIG-I:**  Detects viral ssRNA and transcriptional intermediates in the cytoplasm.
        *   **TLRs:**  TLR3 (dsRNA), TLR7 (ssRNA), and TLR8 (ssRNA) in endosomes; TLRs on cell surface recognize bacterial components.
    *   **Downstream Signaling:** PRR activation triggers signaling cascades leading to the activation of transcription factors (NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7) and the production of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
    *   **Inflammasome Activation:**  The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by IAV infection, contributing to cytokine production.
    *   **Antiviral Molecules:**  IFNs induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral activities, including:
        *   **Mx proteins:** Inhibit viral replication.
        *   **IFITMs:** Restrict viral entry.
        *   **CH25H:** Produces 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks viral fusion.
        *   **TRIM proteins:**  Multiple antiviral mechanisms.
        * **ZAP, OAS-RNase L, and PKR**: target expression of viral mRNA and protein.
*   **Cells of the Innate Immune System:**
    *   **Alveolar macrophages:** Phagocytose infected cells and regulate subsequent immune responses.
    *   **Monocytes:** Recruited to the site of infection.
    *   **NK cells:**  Lyse IAV-infected cells via recognition of viral HA.
    *   **Dendritic cells (DCs):**  Bridge innate and adaptive immunity by presenting viral antigens to T cells.
*   **Adaptive Immune Response:**
    *   **CD8+ T cells (CTLs):** Kill infected cells via recognition of viral peptides presented on MHC class I molecules. Produce cytotoxic granules (perforin, granzymes).
    *   **CD4+ T cells:**  Provide help to B cells and CD8+ T cells. Differentiate into various subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Tregs).
    *   **B cells:** Produce antibodies that neutralize the virus (primarily targeting HA) or mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
*   **Respiratory Mucosal Immunity:**
    *  **sIgA**: important for viral clearance
    * **NALT and BALT**: inductive sites
*   **IAV Evasion Strategies:**
    *   **HA and NA mutations:**  Antigenic drift and shift allow evasion of antibody responses.
    *   **NS1:**  A major IFN antagonist; inhibits multiple steps in the IFN response, including RIG-I activation, PKR activation, and downstream signaling.
    *   **PB1-F2:**  Suppresses IFN responses by interacting with MAVS.
    *   **M2:** Interferes with autophagy.
    *   **Other viral proteins:** PB2.

**4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS**

The host immune response to IAV is a complex interplay of innate and adaptive mechanisms.  While the immune system has multiple strategies to combat IAV, the virus has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade these defenses.  Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.
