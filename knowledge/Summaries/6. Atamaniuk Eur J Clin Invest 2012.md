# Structured Summary: Overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor 5D

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor 5D in the bone marrow is associated with poor prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma
*   **Original Abstract:** **Background** G protein-coupled receptor 5D (GPRC5D) is a novel surface receptor. As this new subtype of G protein-coupled receptors was discovered, little is known about the role of this gene. **Materials and methods** In this retrospective study, we investigated GPRC5D mRNA expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) of 48 patients with multiple myeloma (MM). **Results** Highly variable levels of GPRC5D (median, 288; quartiles, 17–928) were detected in patients with MM, whereas only low expression was detected in normal tissues (median, 1; quartiles, 1–23). High mRNA expression of GPRC5D correlated positively with high plasma cell count in bone marrow (r = 0·64, P < 0·001), high β2-microglobulin (r = 0·42, P = 0·003) and poor-risk cytogenetics: deletion 13q14 (rb-1), P = 0·003; and 14q32 translocation t(4;14)(p16;q32), P = 0·029. GPRC5D mRNA expression showed a significant correlation with overall survival (P = 0·031). The estimated overall survival of patients expressing GPRC5D above or below the median of 288 was 43·9% vs. 70·2% at 48 months. Here, we report, for the first time, the association of GPRC5D expression and cancer. **Conclusions** Overexpression in poor-risk myeloma, low expression in normal tissues and cell surface expression identify GPRC5D as a potential novel cancer antigen. Our data demonstrate that GPRC5D is a prognostic factor in MM correlating with other major risk factors.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This study aimed to investigate the expression of the novel G protein-coupled receptor 5D (GPRC5D) in multiple myeloma (MM) and assess its prognostic significance. The central problem was the lack of knowledge regarding GPRC5D's role in cancer. Given that MM remains largely incurable and requires better risk stratification tools and new therapeutic targets, this research explored GPRC5D as a potential biomarker and cancer antigen. The study provides the first evidence linking GPRC5D to a human malignancy and establishes its value as a predictor of patient outcomes.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
This retrospective study analyzed bone marrow samples from 48 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The primary method was real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to measure the mRNA expression levels of GPRC5D. This expression was then correlated with key clinical and laboratory parameters, including bone marrow plasma cell count, β2-microglobulin levels, and International Staging System (ISS) stage. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Statistical methods, including Spearman's correlation and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to determine the association between GPRC5D expression and disease characteristics and overall survival. GPRC5D expression was also assessed in various healthy tissues and cell lines to determine its specificity.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **GPRC5D is highly overexpressed in MM patients compared to healthy tissues.** The study found that GPRC5D mRNA levels in the bone marrow of MM patients were highly variable but significantly elevated (median expression level of 288) compared to the very low levels found in normal tissues and healthy bone marrow (median of 1).
*   **High GPRC5D expression correlates with established markers of poor prognosis.** GPRC5D expression was significantly and positively correlated with high bone marrow plasma cell count (r=0.64), elevated β2-microglobulin levels (r=0.42), and the presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletion 13q14 (P=0.003) and t(4;14) translocation (P=0.029).
*   **Elevated GPRC5D expression is a significant predictor of worse overall survival.** Patients with GPRC5D mRNA levels above the median had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with lower levels. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an estimated 48-month survival rate of 43.9% for the high-expression group versus 70.2% for the low-expression group (Figure 2a).
*   **GPRC5D exhibits a favorable tumor-specific expression profile.** Analysis of a panel of normal human tissues revealed that GPRC5D expression was largely restricted, with very low or undetectable levels in most essential organs. This tumor-selective expression suggests that GPRC5D could be a promising target for therapies designed to specifically attack cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The study concludes that GPRC5D is a novel and potent prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. Its overexpression is strongly associated with high tumor burden, aggressive disease features, and significantly reduced overall survival. Given its high, specific expression on myeloma cells and low expression in normal tissues, GPRC5D is identified as a potential new therapeutic target for MM. A key limitation is that the study was based on mRNA from unsorted bone marrow, and further research is needed to confirm protein expression and function in MM cells.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Prognostic Marker:** A biological molecule whose level or presence can be used to predict the likely course and outcome of a disease, such as survival time.
    *   **Multiple Myeloma (MM):** A cancer of plasma cells, which are antibody-producing white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow.
    *   **Cancer Antigen:** A molecule expressed by tumor cells that can be recognized by the immune system or targeted by specific therapies (e.g., antibodies, CAR-T cells).
    *   **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR):** A large family of transmembrane proteins that act as cell surface receptors and are common targets for drug development.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **GPRC5D (G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member D):** The specific novel cell surface receptor investigated in this paper. Its function in cancer was previously unknown.
    *   **RT-qPCR (Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction):** A laboratory technique used to measure the amount of a specific RNA molecule, in this case, the mRNA for GPRC5D.
    *   **β2-microglobulin:** A protein whose concentration in the blood is a key established prognostic factor in multiple myeloma, reflecting tumor mass and disease activity.

*   **Novel Insights and Significant Contributions:**
    *   This was the first report to associate the expression of GPRC5D with any form of cancer.
    *   The study established GPRC5D as a strong, independent prognostic factor for overall survival in multiple myeloma.
    *   It identified GPRC5D as a highly promising therapeutic target for MM due to its cell surface location and highly tumor-restricted expression pattern.
