# Structured Summary: IL-35 Regulates the Function of Immune Cells in Tumor Microenvironment

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** IL-35 Regulates the Function of Immune Cells in Tumor Microenvironment
*   **Original Abstract:** Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and IL-12p35 that has recently been shown to play diverse and important roles in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to its immunosuppressive activity and ability to promote tumor growth and progression, IL-35 is widely recognized as a key mediator of TME status. Immune cells are key mediators of diverse tumor-related phenotypes, and immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-35 can promote tumor growth and metastasis in TME. These influences should be considered together. Since tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade remains ineffective in many patients due to tumoral resistance, a new target or efficacy enhancing factor is urgently needed. Suppressing IL-35 production and activity has been demonstrated as an effective factor that inhibits tumor cells viability, and further investigation of this cytokine is warranted. However, the mechanistic basis for IL-35-mediated regulation of immune cells in the TME remains to be fully clarified. In the present review, we explore the roles of IL-35 in regulating immune cells within the TME. In addition, we highlight IL-35 as a specific immunological target and discuss its possible relevance in the context of immunotherapy. Lastly, we sought to summarize potential future research directions that may guide the advancement of current understanding regarding the role of this important cytokine as a regulator of oncogenesis.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This review synthesizes the current understanding of Interleukin-35 (IL-35) and its multifaceted role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It addresses how this immunosuppressive cytokine promotes tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the function of various immune cells. The study's relevance lies in the context of cancer immunotherapy resistance. By highlighting IL-35's mechanisms, the paper explores its potential as a new therapeutic target to enhance anti-tumor immunity and overcome the limitations of current treatments like immune checkpoint blockade.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
As a review article, the methodology consists of a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of the existing scientific literature. The authors collate findings from a wide range of preclinical and clinical studies to explore the functions of Interleukin-35 (IL-35) in cancer. The paper systematically reviews research on how IL-35 is produced by various cells (e.g., regulatory T cells, tumor cells) and its subsequent impact on the function of key immune cells within the TME, including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The authors then integrate these findings to discuss IL-35's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a key immunosuppressive cytokine that promotes tumor growth, progression, and metastasis.** It is produced by various cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and the tumor cells themselves.
*   **IL-35 exerts its pro-tumor effects by directly suppressing the function of anti-tumor effector T cells.** It induces exhaustion in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and impairs the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Figure 1 illustrates that IL-35 signaling can also convert conventional T cells into induced regulatory T cells (iTr35), further amplifying immunosuppression.
*   **The cytokine creates a suppressive network by modulating multiple immune cell types.** It drives the differentiation of conventional B cells into IL-35-producing regulatory B cells (i35-Bregs) and can convert immunogenic dendritic cells (DCs) into tolerogenic DCs. It also promotes the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) towards a pro-tumor M2 phenotype.
*   **There is a significant interplay between IL-35 and the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway.** IL-35 can upregulate the expression of PD-1 on T cells, contributing to their exhaustion. This suggests that blocking IL-35 could be a strategy to overcome resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapies, as shown in the context of NSCLC (Figure 3).

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The review concludes that Interleukin-35 is a central regulator of tumor progression, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment by inhibiting anti-tumor immune cells and promoting regulatory cell functions. This positions IL-35 as a promising therapeutic target. Suppressing IL-35 activity, potentially in combination with existing immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors, could overcome tumor resistance and enhance treatment efficacy. A key limitation is that the mechanistic basis of IL-35's diverse roles is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed before these strategies can be translated into clinical applications.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Interleukin-35 (IL-35):** An immunosuppressive cytokine from the IL-12 family that plays a key role in creating a tumor-protective immune environment.
    *   **Tumor Microenvironment (TME):** The complex ecosystem of immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and signaling molecules that surrounds a tumor and influences its growth and response to therapy.
    *   **Regulatory Immune Cells (Tregs and Bregs):** Subsets of T and B lymphocytes that actively suppress immune responses. IL-35 promotes their expansion and function, thereby protecting the tumor from immune attack.
    *   **Immune Checkpoint Pathway:** Signaling pathways, such as PD-1/PD-L1, that normally prevent excessive immune reactions but are often exploited by tumors to evade the immune system.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Cytokine:** A small protein that acts as a chemical messenger between cells, particularly those of the immune system. They can be either pro-inflammatory (activating) or anti-inflammatory (suppressive).
    *   **Immunosuppression:** The reduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system. In cancer, an immunosuppressive TME protects the tumor from being destroyed by immune cells.
    *   **Regulatory T cells (Tregs):** A type of immune cell whose main job is to "put the brakes" on the immune system to prevent it from attacking the body's own tissues. Cancer cells can hijack Tregs to protect the tumor from being attacked.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   The review consolidates the view of IL-35 as a "master regulator" of the immunosuppressive TME, acting on a wide range of immune cells to promote cancer growth.
    *   It strongly proposes that targeting IL-35 is a viable strategy to overcome resistance to existing cancer immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.
    *   It highlights the complex feedback loops involving IL-35, where the cytokine not only suppresses immunity but also induces other cells to produce more of itself, creating a self-sustaining suppressive state.
