# Structured Summary: Consensus guidelines and recommendations for infection prevention in multiple myeloma

**ESSENTIAL PAPER INFORMATION**

*   **Original Title:** Consensus guidelines and recommendations for infection prevention in multiple myeloma: a report from the International Myeloma Working Group
*   **Original Abstract:** Infection remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma because of the cumulative effect of disease, treatment, and host-related factors. Given that infectious risk is cumulative through the course of the disease, preventing infections is paramount. Optimal preventive strategies include vaccination against common pathogens, antimicrobial prophylaxis, infection control measures, and immunoglobulin replacement in a small subset of patients; however, there are no universally accepted guidelines for infection prevention. This Review provides a consensus statement from a panel of 36 experts with global representation, which was convened by The International Myeloma Society to review existing literature and current guidelines, address issues associated with the risk of infection and prevention of infectious complications in multiple myeloma in the context of emerging therapies, and offer recommendations for preventing these complications.

### 1. OVERVIEW
This paper provides a consensus statement from the International Myeloma Working Group, offering evidence-based guidelines for preventing infections in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The central problem is the lack of universally accepted standards for infection prevention in MM, a population with high infection-related morbidity and mortality due to cumulative immunosuppression from the disease and its treatments. This review is clinically critical as it provides a comprehensive framework for managing infection risk in the context of emerging, potent immunotherapies, aiming to standardize and improve supportive care for MM patients globally.

### 2. MAIN METHODOLOGY
The methodology involved convening a panel of 36 global experts in multiple myeloma and infectious diseases by the International Myeloma Society. This panel conducted a comprehensive review of existing literature and current clinical guidelines from organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Through a series of international workshops and teleconferences, the experts discussed the evidence and formulated consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then graded using NCCN criteria (Category 1, 2A, or 2B) based on the level of evidence and the uniformity of the panel's consensus.

### 3. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Vaccination is a critical preventive strategy, with specific recommendations for timing and type.** Patients should receive inactivated vaccines, ideally before starting therapy or when in remission to maximize efficacy. Key recommendations include an annual two-dose series of high-dose influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13 followed by PPSV23), and the recombinant zoster vaccine for all MM patients, particularly post-transplant.
*   **Risk-adapted antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended, especially during high-risk periods.** The first three months after diagnosis and periods of relapsed/refractory disease treatment pose the highest infection risk. Levofloxacin prophylaxis is recommended during the initial three months of therapy. Acyclovir prophylaxis is strongly recommended for patients receiving proteasome inhibitors or anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies to prevent VZV reactivation.
*   **Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG) is reserved for a small, well-defined subset of patients.** Routine IVIG is not recommended. Its use should be limited to patients with serum IgG levels below 400 mg/dL who experience severe, recurrent bacterial infections despite appropriate vaccination and antimicrobial prophylaxis.
*   **Infection risk varies significantly with the type of myeloma therapy.** Proteasome inhibitors increase the risk of herpes zoster reactivation. Monoclonal antibodies are associated with lymphopenia and viral infections. Novel immune therapies like CAR-T cells and bispecific antibodies lead to profound immunosuppression, requiring specific, intensive prophylactic measures detailed in the guidelines.

### 4. MAIN CONCLUSIONS
The prevention of infection in multiple myeloma patients requires a proactive, individualized approach based on the patient's disease status, treatment regimen, and host factors. These consensus guidelines provide a much-needed, evidence-based framework for clinicians to standardize vaccination protocols, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and the selective use of immunoglobulin therapy. Implementing these recommendations is intended to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with infections in this vulnerable population. A key limitation is that many recommendations are based on lower-level evidence and expert consensus, highlighting the need for future prospective studies.

### 5. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Cumulative Immunosuppression:** The progressive weakening of the immune system over the course of the disease due to the combined effects of the myeloma itself and multiple lines of therapy.
    *   **Risk-Adapted Prophylaxis:** Tailoring the use of preventive antibiotics and antivirals to a patient's specific risk level, which is determined by factors like their type of treatment, disease stage, and history of infections.
    *   **Vaccine Hyporesponsiveness:** The diminished ability of multiple myeloma patients to generate a protective immune response following vaccination, which is often influenced by their current disease activity and treatment.
    *   **Infection Prevention Guidelines:** A set of standardized, evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of infections.

*   **Essential Technical Terms:**
    *   **Immunoparesis:** A state of weakened immune function that is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. It involves impaired production of normal antibodies and dysfunction of various immune cells.
    *   **Antimicrobial Prophylaxis:** The use of medications such as antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals to prevent an infection from occurring.
    *   **Inactivated Vaccine:** A vaccine created from a virus or bacterium that has been killed. These vaccines cannot cause disease and are safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, unlike live attenuated vaccines.

*   **Novel Insights or Significant Contributions:**
    *   This report represents the first comprehensive, globally-endorsed set of consensus guidelines for infection prevention in multiple myeloma, developed by the International Myeloma Working Group.
    *   It provides specific, actionable recommendations tailored to modern myeloma therapies, including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and emerging cellular therapies.
    *   It formalizes key recommendations, such as the use of the recombinant zoster vaccine for all MM patients and a two-dose, high-dose strategy for influenza vaccination, to improve immunogenicity in this population.
